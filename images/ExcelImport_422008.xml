B­17's of the 'Bloody Hundredth' attack a target at Ruhland, Germany. Main subject is 'Mason and Dixon.'

The Story

High over the European continent lies a battlefield of immense size that has no markers, no monuments and no evidence that any struggle between men and nations ever took place just sixty short years ago. It has no borders or road signs to enlighten anyone where these battles raged, battles involving young men from opposing forces that exacted a toll of a quarter of a million casualties and changed the course of humanity forever.

Among the young American men who rose to the challenge, no finer examples can be found than those in the 100th Bomb Group, or as they came to be known, 'The Bloody Hundredth.' Facing overwhelming odds, particularly in 1942-1943, when aircrews could not expect to survive more than 10 missions, the Hundredth faced the worst that the Germans could throw at them. Raging flak and Luftwaffe tactics aside, they faced the fear of the unknown, often unescorted by fighters.

Despite all of this, the result was a victory that reverberates around the world to this day. As memories fade and the ranks grow fewer and fewer, their legacy lives on, and stands as a marker for future generations.

Depicted in Robert Bailey's AMERICA'S CENTURY is a mission flown by the 100th Bomb Group on September 11, 1944, to Ruhland, Germany. Elements of the aircraft emerge from the bomb run, having delivered their payloads over the target.

The official group history reads:

"At 26,000 feet the C Squadron was attacked by approximately 40 enemy aircraft, FW­190's and Me­109's. The e/a came in a 'schwarm' from 6 o'clock, opening fire with 20mm from 400 yards. After this one mass attack, a few single e/a broke away from the 'schwarm' and made a 360 degree turn and again attacked crippled aircraft in the 100th C Squadron. In a few moments, all but one of our aircraft disappeared beneath the under-cast, about half of them appearing to be under control."

This attack destroyed the Low Squadron of B­17's, and then German fighters returned to attack from the front and rear. Many of these fighters were shot down, but the 100th lost twelve crews this day. It is this second wave attack by the Luftwaffe which is depicted here. Valiant 'Mason and Dixon,' shown in AMERICA'S CENTURY was in the B (High) Group, low element, and is seen fending off an attack by a FW­190. She claimed four German fighters during her many missions over Europe.

Arriving at Andover-Hants, England, in February 1944, the 370th Fighter Group of the Ninth Air Force comprised the 401, 402 and 485 Fighter Squadrons. They took up residence at the former RAF Station #406 on Salisbury Plain. Trained Stateside in the P­47, the group were surprised when handed the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. Missions included attacking radar installations, rolling stock, flack towers and escort for the 8th and 9th Bomb Groups to France and Germany.

In Robert Bailey's exquisite pencil sketch, ANDOVER CROSSING, depicting 402 Squadron, the lead P-38J exiting the dispersal area is that of CO Major Tim Tucker (E6T). As he crosses Red Post Lane and onto Andover's grassy field, other bomb laden Lightnings head out overhead for another mission.

The arctic convoy battles of 1942 were among the most hazardous for the allies. Challenged by the intimidating German surface fleet, submarine forces and the ever present Luftwaffe, the multinational merchantmen relied upon the over-stretched and overworked Royal Navy for protection.

In addition, the allies had to deal with the natural ebb and flow of the seasons in the extreme northern hemisphere. During winter, ice packs forced the convoys further south toward the enemy, while in summer the long hours of daylight exposed them to the ever marauding German forces. It was the task of the German air force and navy to halt the supply of war material to their natural enemy, Russia, by whatever means.

In convoy PQ-17, their coordinated attack resulted in the sinking of a staggering 23 of the 34 convoy vessels.

Oberst Hajo Herrmann was one of the Luftwaffe's boldest and most innovative air tacticians during WWII. Beginning his military career at an infantry officer academy, he was commissioned in the newly formed Luftwaffe in 1935. He became a founder member of the Condor Legion in Spain and upon returning to Germany in 1937, joined KG­4 and wrote several highly praised tactics reports.

When WWII began, he flew He-111's in Poland and Norway. By 1940 Herrmann was Commander of the 7th Staffel of KG­4, and led many attacks on England during the Battle of Britain. In February of 1941 his group went to Sicily, where they flew against Malta and Greece. In one such attack, he placed a single bomb on a munitions ship. The resulting explosion sank 11 ships and made the Greek port of Piraeus unusable for months.

In early 1942 he was Commander of III/KG30, attacking arctic convoys from Norway, including the famous attacks on PQ-17. July of 1942 saw him assigned to the general staff in Germany, where he became a close confidant of Herrmann Goering. Hajo Herrmann was creator of the 'wild boar' tactics of night fighting in the Defence of the Reich. By 1944 he was Inspector General of night fighters. He has a tally of over three hundred operational missions and nine RAF bombers destroyed. Hajo Herrmann received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. He is currently practicing law in Germany.

Frank Saies-Jones served on various ships, including HMS Woolwich in Port Said, HMS Kelvin, a destroyer of the 14th Destroyer Flotilla based in Alexandria, Egypt. He retired with the rank of Lt. Commander with the 1939-45 Star, the Atlantic Star, the Africa Star, the CVSM &amp; Clasp, the Defence Medal, the Victory Medal, the Canadian Centennial Medal, the Canadian Forces Decoration &amp; Bar, and the Malta Medal.

C. N. Mawer was a First Lieutenant in HMCS Nootka at war's start, and later Gunnery Control Officer on HMCS Haida, a tribal class destroyer, based at Scapa Flow as part of the British Home Fleet, screening the battle fleet and escorting Russia-bound convoys. Mawer was involved in numerous actions, and retired with the rank of Commander. His awards included the 1939-45 Star, the Atlantic Star with France &amp; Germany Bar, the Volunteer Medal, the Victory Medal, the British Arctic Medal, and the Russian Medal.

John C. (Jim) Colman served on the Canadian Tribal Class destroyer HMCS Huron in 1944, escorting convoys through the Arctic Ocean to the port of Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula in Northern Russia. Able Seaman Gunner Colman was awarded the 1939-45 Star, the France-Germany Star, the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal &amp; Clasp, the War Medal, and the Soviet 40th Anniversary Medal (Murmansk Medal).

Donald W. Newman served on the destroyer HMCS Athabaskan. In December 1943 he was in this ship on Russia-bound convoy duty. She was eventually torpedoed and sank with great loss of life. Newman was taken prisoner by the Germans. His awards include the 1939-45 Star, the Atlantic Star, the Defence Medal, the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal &amp; Clasp, the Victory Medal, and the Soviet 40th Anniversary Medal (Murmansk Medal).</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>The arctic convoy battles of 1942 were among the most hazardous for the allies.

The Story

By the autumn of 1943 the eastern front was in a desperate predicament for Germany. Crippled with a Fuhrer who insisted upon making battle plans with a disregard for his generals' warnings, the German army endured unbelievable hardships. In addition to facing another brutal Russian winter, battling on two fronts was draining her ability to combat her foe to the east.

Russia, supported by bustling war factories safe in the Ural Mountains, had allies who were sending war materials to her growing army and air forces. The tide of battle had taken a bad turn for the Wehrmacht.

But despite the mounting pressure and defeats, the Germans put up a stiff resistance as they retreated further west toward their homeland. The superior training, from Field Marshall on down to the regular foot soldier, allowed the Germans to withdraw in an orderly fashion across natural obstacles that otherwise could have proved disastrous.

Supported by an overtaxed Lufwaffe, the German army put up a valiant fight. Air cover and ground attack units of the German air force had spent many years working out their mutually supportive roles that had their origins in the Spanish Civil War.

In Robert Bailey's painting, BEAR TRAP, German field artillery has surprised an advancing Russian armored column near the town of Smolensk during October 1943.

Panzers clash with Russian T­34's. In the foreground, a T­34 is still racing forward, a blazing wreck. Around the perimeter of the forest clearing are dug-in German positions, firing upon the Russians. Low left, three Russian soldiers sneak up behind German tanks. In right mid-ground, another T­34 is abandoned by its crew. The shadow of the giant explosions in the background partly conceals the stalled Russian column, as troops mill around.

Above the ground battle, Stukas from Schlachtgeschwader 2 (Oberst Hans Ulrich Rudel*), escorted by Focke Wulf 190's of JG­51 (Horst Petzschier), pound the Russian armor with cannon and bombs, effectively halting the advance of their foe.

Near the horizon, Yak-9s swarm into th frav, and a Sturmovik spots a Ju­52 which is dropping supplies to a German unit in a nearby battle. As the Russians reel in the shock of the ambush, the Germans have resisted the charge of the Russian Bear, if only in a momentary victory.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>October 1943.

As the invasion of the European continent approached in the winter/spring of 1944, the missions of the 8th and 9th Air Forces began adjusting tactically and strategically in preparation for Operation Overlo Often, initial sorties consisted of fighter escorts for Bomber Command to ensure adequate protection was given and that the bomber missions reached assigned targets. These consisted of fighter relays between groups, squadrons and Air Forces.

After completing escort missions, these fighters were then free to attack targets such as marshalling yards, convoys, flak emplacements, trains, or enemy airfields.

Ground attacks were extremely hazardous. While air to air combat relied upon skill and first-sighting of the enemy, ground attack relied on a large measure of luck and courage. Many a successful combat pilot perished or was taken prisoner after being shot down from the intense defensive fire that was thrown up while flying 'on the deck.' Enemy airfields were particularly hazardous as they were often ringed by a multi-array of anti-aircraft flak batteries.

detailIn Bluenoser Bounce, fighters from 328 Fighter Squadron, 352nd Fighter Group, are seen attacking Herbeville airfield on April 28, 1944. They have just finished an escort mission with B­17's from the 91st and 381st Bomb Groups which attacked a German airfield at Avord, France.

Lt. Robert H. Powell Junior, flying 'The West "By Gawd" Virginian', has overflown the hangar at the north end of the aerodrome, having destroyed a Ju-88 in the process. Attempting to exit his strafing run, he was hit by an explosive 20mm shell in his tail section, causing him to prepare for an immediate bail-out.

Calm thinking and excellent reflexes enabled him to regain control of his crippled Mustang and nurse it back to Bodney, England. His wingman was not so lucky. Lt. Jamie Laing was also struck by anti-aircraft fire from the opposite direction, taking hits in the radiator and sealing the fate of his plane. Lt. Laing parachuted a few miles away and became a POW. He spent the rest of the war in Stalag Luft 1.

Signatures

Lieutenant Charles M. Price was born in East Orange, New Jersey. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps as an Aviation Cadet in August 1942 and trained on P­40's. He was assigned to the 352nd Fighter Group, 486 Fighter Squadron at Bodney, England. His first mission was in a P­51 Mustang. He completed 27 operational missions destroying three German aircraft on the ground. He remained in the air force after war's end, and flew P­47's until May 1951.

Lieutenant James N. White enlisted on his 18th birthday, and was in Bodney two years later. He flew twenty missions, mostly as escort to B­17's and B­24's over Germany. He also flew strafing missions that saw upward of seventy enemy aircraft on fire. His P­51 suffered a direct hit from small arms fire while strafing, and the bullet missed his neck by a fraction of an inch. During another mission, he was shot down at 500 feet and bailed out over France. On March 17, 1945, he destroyed an Me­109 over Berlin. During April 1945 over Bavaria, he destroyed five enemy aircraft on the ground. Lt. White set a high altitude record for the P­51 Mustang at 43,500 feet. Among his awards was the DFC and two Air Medals. He also received the Presidential Unit's Citation.

Major General Cuthbert A. (Bill) Pattillo was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and flew Mustangs with the 352nd Fighter Group on 35 combat missions. He shot down a Messerschmitt 262 jet in a dog fight and six other enemy aircraft on the ground. Whilst with the 352nd Fighter Group he was awarded the DFC and Air Medal, with two Oak Leaf Clusters. After the war he flew jet aircraft with the USAF and together with his twin brother, Charles C. Pattillo, was instrumental in organizing and forming the 'Thunderbirds.'

Lieutenant Robert H. 'Punchy' Powell was born in Wilcoe, West Virginia. His first combat was in P­47's with 328 Squadron of the 352nd Fighter Group at Bodney, England. In early 1944, the squadron switched to Mustangs. He has 83 combat missions and an unofficial score of 6-2-7 enemy aircraft destroyed in the air and on the ground. He piloted 'The West "By Gawd" Virginian.' His awards include DFC with two OLC's, Air Medal with three OLC's, the DUC, and four Battle Stars.

Major General Luther H. Richmond was born in Chicopee, Mass. In March 1943 he took command of 486 Fighter Squadron at Farmingdale, Long Island, NY, and that July went with them to England.

Decorations include DSC, DFC with two Oak Leaf Clusters, as well as the Air Medal with fourteen Oak Leaf Clusters.
Ground Crew:

Staff Sergeant Earl Lange joined the service in July 1942 and attended armament school at Denver, Colorado. While at Bodney, England, he was sent to ground gunnery school on a British base at Land's End. He was too colourblind to be an aerial gunner, and therefore instructed instead. He was called back to 486 Fighter Squadron , 352nd Fighter Group before D­Day. He was then in France at Camp Lucky Strike. While sleeping in a tent in Chievres, Belgium, his carbine was stolen, and he had to pay $15 restitution before he was allowed to leave the service!

Staff Sergeant Ken Bailey joined the service at Camp Attenbury, Indiana. The man who handled his induction paperwork was his High School Ag. teacher. Boot camp was in Florida. In January 1943 he was posted to the 352nd Fighter Group. Because he said that he could read a thermometer, he was immediately assigned as the 352nd weather person! At Bodney, he spotted winds aloft with weather balloons, amongst various other duties. He later was transferred to the 21st Weather Squadron Strategic Air Forces, Europe.

Staff Sergeant James O. Bleidner was born in New York City and grew up in Islip, Long Island, NY. He was called into the Army Air Force in September 1942 and served with the 352nd Fighter Group, 487 Squadron, as an armorer. He served in England and Belgium. For most of the time, he was the armorer for Colonel J. G. Meyer, who was at various times Squadron Commander and Group Commander.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>April 28, 1944.

The Story

In the annals of air combat history, stretching from WWI to WWII, no definitive sacrifice and hardship is clearer than that of the Polish and Czech airmen who served in air forces of other countries.

Displaced by the German juggernaut that rolled firstly through eastern and then western Europe at the out-break of the second world war, they rallied against the invaders by fighting with France. When France fell, they joined the last island of freedom by serving with the RAF in Britain. From 1940 until the Americans showed up in force to join in the fight in 1942, the outcome for liberty and national existence hung in the balance, defended only in the air by these few. It became a daily slug-fest, pitting themselves against a seasoned adversary.

Their history of heroism and fighting tenacity is legendary. Formed into squadrons, they served honorably and contributed to the final victory over an equally tenacious and battle-hardened Luftwaffe. The old adage of 'all gave some, some gave all,' befits their fighting spirit and supported the impressive final victory in Europe.

These valiant men would suffer personally and at great hardship for decades. After the war they were denied the rewards of participating in the liberation of millions, as their country fell under the regime of communist oppressive policies. Their association with the west during the war made them suspect, with many dying from performing menial tasks or from imprisonment after long years in mines or gulags.

This does not diminish their record of service, but rather enhances it that much more, fulfilling their duty and honor to their country in a time of need. Their perseverance serves as a shining example to their countrymen today.

In Robert Bailey's combat masterpiece, COASTAL CONFLICT, a Czech Spitfire unit of the RAF is seen locked in combat over Cherbourg, France, in June of 1942. Initially assigned to escort Boston bombers to a French target, they engage in a melee with attacking German FW­190's over the coast. In addition to the German fighters, the Czech squadron has to worry about erupting defensive fire from ships and ground defenses.
Czechoslovak Airmen in World War II

by Jan Zdiarsky

When Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939, these were young men. They were students, army airmen, workers and technicians.

The patriotism and pride, together with a thirst for freedom, called for them to escape from occupied territory and give their knowledge and ability to the Allies. They fought from the first days of the war in Poland and later in France, where some of them gave great credit to their country. Shortly after France fell, these Czechoslovaks escaped to Great Britain, where they joined the RAF and continued to fight until 1945.

To Germans, they were citizens of the Third Reich. With the shoulder patch 'Czechoslovakia' on their RAF uniforms, they risked execution by the Gestapo if captured.

Czechoslovak airmen fought and died in all theaters of the war around the world. Over 550 of them were killed.

After hostilities ended and the surviving heroes returned home, they had a short time of glory. But then the communist regime in 1948 immediately jailed many and persecuted all of them. Czechoslovak airmen waited another forty years for the freedom they had fought so hard to achieve.

The Story
Lt. Czypionka is one of the very few Luftwaffe pilots who flew the revolutionary Messerschmitt 262 jet during night operations in WWII. This was the Kommando Welter 10/NJG­11 and Jorg flew 'Red 6.' Another 262 takes off while Lt. Czypionka climbs for height. Below, we see two night fighter Me­110's warming up for night missions, with ground crew standing by. An Me­109 is parked after its day's work. Because a black-out was in effect, runway lights were lit for only a few minutes. For the same reason, a mechanic hastily closes a workshop door to prevent light from being seen by marauding Allied fighters.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>In early 1945, Leutnant Jorg Czypionka takes off from his base at Burg-bei-Magdeburg in Germany, to defend the area from an incoming Lancaster raid.</SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><SKU>RB-012</SKU><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><XmlPackage>product.simplevariantformat.xml.config</XmlPackage><ColWidth>4</ColWidth><SalesPromptID>1</SalesPromptID><Published>1</Published><RequiresRegistration>0</RequiresRegistration><RelatedProducts></RelatedProducts><MiscText></MiscText><TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor>0</TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor><TrackInventoryBySize>0</TrackInventoryBySize><TrackInventoryByColor>0</TrackInventoryByColor><IsAKit>0</IsAKit><IsAPack>0</IsAPack><PackSize></PackSize><ImageFilenameOverride>dark-defenders_540.jpg</ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData><ProductVariant><Name>Limited Edition</Name><IsDefault>1</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-LE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With THREE co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>245</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>24x34</Dimensions><Inventory>70</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Artist's Proofs</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-AP</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With THREE co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>295</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>24x34</Dimensions><Inventory>20</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Remarqued Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-RE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With THREE co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>395</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>24x34</Dimensions><Inventory>10</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Studio Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-SE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>Signed by the artist only.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>160</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>24x34</Dimensions><Inventory>400</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant></Product><Product><Name>Dawn Intrusion</Name><ProductTypeRef>Artist Print</ProductTypeRef><ManufacturerRef>Robert Bailey</ManufacturerRef><DistributorRef>Robert Bailey</DistributorRef><CategoryRef>/Aviation Art</CategoryRef><CategoryRef></CategoryRef><CategoryRef></CategoryRef><CategoryRef></CategoryRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><Summary></Summary><Description>February 1945 at Brandenburg-Briest, Germany.

Oberleutnant Walter Schuck first flew in combat flying the Me­109. In April 1942 he was based at Petsamo, Finland and began his impressive tally of victories. He finally had 206 confirmed aerial victories, including eight flying the Me­262 jet. He was awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.

Unteroffizier Fritz Wiener joined the Luftwaffe in 1942 at the age of 17. He was briefly with Jagdgruppe 200 during the Normandy Invasion and was with JG­11 during the Battle of the Bulge and participated in Operation Bodenplatte. By January of 1945 he was re-deployed to Berlin/Straussberg to fight advancing Soviet forces.

Captain R. Winks was born in Sumner, Iowa. In England he was assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Leiston, flying P­51's. He scored his first victory in November 1944, with a second in December. Then on January 14, 1945, he had another 2­1/2 victories and the next day on a mission to Augsburg he saw a Me­262 jet slow rolling near its field and shot it down in flames. He had 69 combat missions.

1st Lieutenant Norm Achen flew with the 4th Fighter Group, 334 Fighter Squadron from Debden, England from June 1 to August 15, 1944. He was shot down by ground fire in his P­51 while searching for targets of opportunity after escorting B­24's to Hanover. Norm later escaped from a POW camp and after 15 days reached a General Patton tank unit.

Lt. Colonel Bob Wright trained on the P-38 Lightning at Van Nuys AFB. He was transferred overseas to Italy, to the 52nd Fighter Group, 97 Fighter Squadron , still on P-38's. OverLintz, Austria, he spotted a Me­262 jet on take-off roll. He dived on the target, but it was hard to spot because of its camouflage and so escaped. Bob was mostly on bomber escort and dive bomber missions and he retired as a Lt. Colonel.

Colonel Raymond F. Toliver entered the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1937 and trained as a pursuit pilot. Colonel Toliver became a famous author. Books include The Blonde Knight of Germany (Erich Hartmann), andThe Interrogator (Hanns Joachim Scharff, who coincidentally interrogated Norm Achen, co-signer on this print). In 1940 he resigned and joined TWA as an airline pilot. In 1942 he was with RAF Ferry Command, flying Hudsons and Liberators trans-Atlantic. He then re-joined the Army Air Corps and was Chief of Flight Testing at Fairfield Air Depot, Ohio.

Leutnant Theo Nau joined the Luftwaffe in 1943. His first missions were with home defense (JG­11) and he then flew in the Ardennes Offensive and Operation Bodenplatte. Later, he was with JG­77 in Czechoslovakia. He saw action in both the FW­190 and the Me­109.

Oberleutnant Kurt Schulze began service as a cadet in 1939. He flew combat in Me­110's over Russia and in Do­217's. After service with KG­2 he flew Me­109's with JG­5 from Finland and Norway. In early 1945 he commanded l/JG­51 at Gdansk. Kurt ended the war commanding 13/JG­5. He has 3 victories.

The Story

Modern day world history would be quite different had German scientists and military architects been allowed free reign with the design and execution of their blueprints early in the European war. As far back as the mid 1930's these visionary engineers and military application designers had crafted exotic weapon concepts onto paper that catapulted air war into the 21st century. Their creations became known as 'wonder weapons' and encompassed the first operational jet aircraft (Me­262), the rocket plane (Me­163), and the intercontinental ballistic missile (V­2). These revelations no doubt came as a complete shock to the Allies when first encountered, to the extent that the eyewitnesses were not believed.

But the outcome of the war was another example of 'too little, too late.' The tide had shifted in favor of the Allies, supported in large part by America's war production turning out planes, tanks and munitions, overwhelmed German industry. Fighting a continental war on two fronts was too much for these new weapons which were just entering combat service. They ultimately had minimal impact on reversing Germany's attempt at world domination.

Hitler's meddling in the design and implementation of these weapons played a large role in delaying them from entering the war at an earlier time, dooming the Reich's chances of turning the tide in their own favor.

Still, the designs of the world's first combat jet aircraft and its brief war record was exemplary. Flying at well over 100 mph faster than the fastest Allied aircraft, they raised havoc among bomber streams when they engaged them during the Allies daily missions to bomb Germany into submission. Flown by 'experten' pilots who had demonstrated mastery of combat flying, this weapon was a serious threat to the Allies.

Originally test flown in 1941 and available for combat in May of 1944, the 'Swallow' was vulnerable to attack when taking off or landing, because of the necessarily lower speed. It was on these occasions that the fighter pilots of the 8th and 9th A.F. learned to pounce on these jets.

JG­7In Robert Bailey's combat canvas, DAWN INTRUSION, Walter Schuck aborts his landing at Brandenburg-Briest when he sees that it is under attack by American Mustangs. Fellow Luftwaffe jet pilots preparing to take off at the end of the runway firewall their Jumo jet engines to escape the rapidly escalating strike in the target rich environment. Specialized Me­109's guarding the vulnerable jets pass overhead to engage the incoming threat of more P­51's. The air is tense with adrenalin and terse RT chatter as pilots manouevre into the most favorable position. In this case, the Luftwaffe faces overwhelming odds.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>February 1945 at Brandenburg-Briest, Germany.

2nd Lieutenant Leonard H. Brown was born in Versailles, Missouri, and enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in July 1940. He was with 309 Squadron and by May 1942 was in England, flying the British Spitfire Mk. V in a reverse 'lend lease' arrangement. Based at Chichester on the south coast, they flew fighter sweeps across the English Channel to France. First major encounter was August 19, 1942, over Dieppe. He flew four combat missions that day. When the press learned that the USA pilots felt the Spitfire was far superior to the P­39, this did not go over well with the top brass. In late 1942 the Squadron was shipped to Africa, where they continued flying Spitfires. 2nd Lt. Brown ended his military career as a Colonel, with one victory. Awards include Legion of Merit, DFC, Air Medal with 6 OLC's, and Bronze Star. His aircraft 'Dee' is featured in DEFIANCE AT DIEPPE.

2nd Lieutenant Jerry D. Collinsworth was born in Dublin, Texas. He is one of the few Americans to become an ace flying the Supermarine Spitfire. March 1942 saw him in England flying in the 31st Fighter Group, 307 Squadron. This was the first 'Yank' fighter unit in the country since WWI. On August 19, 1942, he received his 'baptism of fire' above the ill-fated commando raid on the coast of France. Later, Collinsworth helped spearhead Operation Torch landings in Oran, Algeria, still flying Spitfires. He covered the landings at southern Sicily, flying from Malta's sister island Gozo. In 125 combat sorties, he shot down 6 Axis aircraft, 1 probable and 1 damaged. He finished his military career as a Colonel. His Spitfire is seen low left in DEFIANCE AT DIEPPE. Awards include DFC with 1 OLC, Air Medal with 17 OLC's, the Purple Heart and Army Commendation Medal.

Flying Officer Don Murchie joined the RCAF in 1941, training on Tiger Moths and Cessna Cranes. Posted to Bournemouth, England, he was selected for day fighters and had further training on Miles Masters and Hurricanes. Selected for Spitfires, he eventally ended up in 412 Squadron. He was involved in dive bombing and armed reconnaissance flights in the Ruhr areas, as well as fighter sweeps throughout the air space east of the Rhine River. Don flew over 80 operational sorties and is credited with numerous ground vehicles, locomotives and motorcycles destroyed.

Flying Officer Douglas Gaudin enlisted in the RCAF in 1940 and received operational training on Hurricanes at Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire, England. He was posted to 122 Squadron RAF, on Spitfires at Scorton, Yorkshire, in February 1942. Douglas was later transferred to the Middle East via West Africa. He then joined 417 Squadron RCAF in October 1942 at a base near Alexandria, flying Hurricanes. Later, he was on Spitfires. The main task of the squadron at this time was the defense of Alexandria Harbor and the interception of German photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Douglas is credited with nearly a hundred operational sorties. He retired with the rank of F/Lt.

Flight Sergeant Douglas R. Matheson was with 411 Squadron, RCAF on Spitfires. He was involved in the action over Dieppe, where is he shown in DEFIANCE AT DIEPPE attacking a Dornier 217. He later became a Flight Lieutenant and Commander of B Flight. Bases from which he flew include Hornchurch, Duxford, Digby, Kenley and Biggin Hill. He flew a total of 153 operational sorties. His tally is 2 enemy aircraft destroyed, with one claimed and one other damaged. On December 1, 1943, he was shot down and became a POW at Stalag Luft III.
The Story

One of the largest air battles of World War 2 occurred on August 19, 1942 over the French port of Dieppe. The planned amphibious assault, code named 'Operation Jubilee' was initiated in the early morning hours of August 19, and lasted less than nine hours. But in that short time the British attempt at testing Hitler's 'Atlantic Wall' and new battle doctrines, turned into a disaster for the ground forces, costing the Allies substantial casualties.

Of a nearly 6100 assault force made up of mostly Canadian troops (4963), 3367 became casualties, either killed in action or taken prisoner. 2210 returned to England with many wounded among them.

In the air, over 49 Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons, some with American pilots, faced off against three hundred Me­109's and FW­190's of JG­2 (Richtofen) and JG­26 (Schlageter). Nearly 1000 aircraft from both sides engaged in a raging air melee in the relatively confined air space over the city of Dieppe. Not since the summer of 1940 and the Battle of Britain had so many planes and aircrew been embroiled in such a conflict. Though outnumbered by nearly 3 to 1, the German defenders lost 48 aircraft to the Allies' 106.

On the surface, 'Operation Jubilee' was nothing short of a disaster of monumental proportions that did not bode well for the Allies or the war in Europe. The raid on Dieppe left little for them to claim as a victory, when reviewing the stark figures in the loss of men and material. Fortress Europa seemed to remain impregnable. This would be true for the time being, except for the invaluable lesson learned from the failed mission. For out of the ashes of the Dieppe raid came the tried and tested battle doctrines, both on the ground and in the air. These doctrines would serve the Allies well a few years later, less than 100 miles south of the beaches of Dieppe in a new operation with the code name 'Overlord.'

In the biggest aerial engagement since the Battle of Britain, American, British and Canadian Spitfires fight it out with the Luftwaffe above the French coast near Dieppe on August 19, 1942. A German 109 pilot parachutes from his stricken machine, risking a spectacular low level jump. Below, German armor can be seen moving to the beach, while on the horizon is the combined Canadian / British ill-fated landing at the town of Dieppe.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>A Spitfire from 309 Squadron (American) zooms past a mortally wounded Messerschmitt 109 'Gustav,' whose pilot attempts to exit his flaming aircraft near the beach head.

The Story

Night time aerial warfare in the European theater was not as obvious to the ground observer as daylight combat. Massive bomber attacks with their attendant contrails could be seen for miles. At best, night aircraft would be heard streaking across the dark void.

Night combat posed different sets of skills and threats unknown to daylight aircrews. The Allied pilots and navigators intruding into enemy airspace in darkness faced the Luftwaffe Me­110's, Ju-88's and FW­190's. These enemy aircraft were tasked with seeking out marauding enemy planes and disposing of them and their crews who were intent on completing their assigned interdiction, mapping and bombing missions. But not all night combat ended in the favor of the Luftwaffe. When shot down behind their own lines, those Germans who survived uninjured would have only wounded pride, the necessary paper reports to complete, and the ride back to the geschwader to fight another day.

In Robert Bailey's painting, DELAYED DEPARTURE, a Me­110 has just left its base, but by unfortunate chance has met a Mosquito in the night sky. The crew of the downed aircraft are assisted out by German rail guards. Meanwhile, the victorious Mossie crew decide to make a low passin order to observe their victory, startling those on the ground. Because of the hissing steam coming from the locomotive, those passengers on the platform are oblivious to the action. This time, the German night fighter crew have been very lucky indeed.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>A Messerschmitt 110 night fighter has been unfortunate to cross swords with a Mosquito night intruder over Germany during the closing years of World War II.

Major Hans E. BobHans-Ekkehard Bob was born in Freiburg/Breisgau, Germany, and grew up in the village of Staufen. In 1936 he joined the Luftwaffe and after training, flew the Arado Ar-68 in Czechoslovakia. But later he was assigned the Bf-109, his favorite fighter. Throughout the war, he flew the B, C, D, E, F and G models of this unique little fighter.

With 9./JG­54 he flew his first combat missions in Poland and France as a Schwarmfuhrer. His first victory was a Gloster Gladiator. He was later given command of 7.Staffel. But on November 28, 1940, he commanded 9.Staffel, where he stayed until August of 1943. Upon joining the 9.Staffel, he asked an unteroffizier of logistics who was a skilled artist, to create several ideas for a unit emblem. The one which Bob chose was the 'Devil's Head,' which was applied to every aircraft and unit vehicle. (After Bob left the unit, the 'Devil's Head' emblem disappeared).

Oberleutnant Hans E. BobBy November 11, 1940, Hans E. Bob had 19 victories and received the Knight's Cross from Reichsmarschall Goring. During the 'Battle of Britain,' Bob's unit was one of the first equipped with 250kg bombs. These were the famed 'Jabo' aircraft. The 9.Staffel were assigned mostly ships and dockyards as their targets.

On June 22, 1941, Hans E. Bob took the 9.Staffel on missions during 'Operation Barbarossa' against Russia. By the end of 1941 he had 39 victories. By September of 1942 he had the magical 50 victories and received a promotion to Hauptmann.

During 'Defense of the Reich,' Bob claimed his 57th victory when he rammed a B­17 Flying Fortress. In August of 1943 he left 9.Staffel and was promoted to Major, becoming the Commander of IV./JG­51. On May 9, 1944, he took command of II./JG­3. In August he commanded II./EJG­2 and was for a short time on the Staff of General Kammhuber in Berlin.

He prepared an airfield at Innsbruck for an Me­262 unit and became a member of JV­44, led by General der Jagdflieger, Adolf Galland. Hans-Ekkehard Bob flew about 700 combat missions and claimed 60 victories.

The Story

Britain knew no darker days than at the height of the 'blitz.' There seemed little in which to take comfort or hope, for in those days the news in North Africa looked bleak and there was mounting shipping loss in the Atlantic as a result of U-boats. She was a desperately embattled nation who stood alone, with only the thinly stretched Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to defend her. Invasion appeared imminent.

Germany, flushed with her recent European conquests, was feverishly attempting to wipe out RAF Fighter Command by bombing the airfields as a prelude to moving troops across the English Channel. But the RAF were highly organized, and with the help of radar, put up a strong fight against the Luftwaffe bombers and their fighter escorts. Frustrated, the Germans switched aim to London and other civilian targets. The thinking was that the RAF would rise to give battle in an attempt to protect the populace and cities.

This was a mistake, for it gave the RAF a breathing space to build up their aircrews, aircraft and bases. It came at a cost to the population and cities. But it was a price that Britain could afford at the time. The result changed the outcome of the Battle of Britain against the Luftwaffe and was a major turning point in the war.

Hans E. Bob in the cockpitIn the meantime, the Luftwaffe were still trying to get the RAF fighters up to engage in combat. The German 'fighter sweeps' over England failed to get the Spitfires and Hurricanes airborne, for their instructions were to fight only if bombs were dropped. So the Germans had a new idea: fitting 250kg bombs to the 109's which could then fly to England as bombers, and revert to their natural fighter role after having released their bombs. Thus was born the 'Jabo' or fighter-bomber. In this tactic, they were marginally successful. Staffelkapitan Hans-Ekkehard Bob's 9./JG­54 was one of the first units to be so equipped, attacking mostly dockyards and ships.

In Robert Bailey's DOCKYARD DELIVERY, Hans Ekkehard-Bob is shown striking such a target near London, creating chaos along the busy dock front.

Bf-109E
Birth of the 'Jabo'

by Hans-Ekkehard Bob
Translated by Ralf Wermann

Our missions against England continued and were increasingly difficult. The poor weather conditions in the fall of 1940 made it almost impossible to fly sorties. Despite all difficulties, the German pilots remained confident.

The British fighters would no longer take off and engage in aerial combat when German bombers were not seen in the skies over Britain. This enabled the German fighters to roam the skies from southern England to London without enemy contact. To lure the British fighters into battle, a few Staffeln of the Messerschmitt Bf­109's were fitted with bomb racks. This may have been the birth of the 'Jagdbomber,' or fighter-bomber.

As Staffelkapitan of 9./JG54, I was to attempt a test flight with a 250kg bomb attached under the fuselage of a Bf­109. At the time, this was considered almost impossible and a 'Himmelsfahrkommando' or suicide mission, because it wasn't known if the aircraft could withstand the added weight of the bomb. As fighter pilots, we had no idea of how to go about with bombs, how to aim and hit a target, or even how to go about flying a bombing mission. I actually had no prior experience with bombing.

Mechanic beside Bf-109EThe takeoff with the bomb, from a meadow at Quines, was quite risky. As I became airborne, I realized that I just couldn't drop the bomb anywhere. What should I do with the bomb? As in so many previous occasions, I again realized how often spontaneous decisions were made. Without much deliberation, I notice that from the British mainland a small piece of land extended toward the sea. (Dungeness). This was where I could perhaps drop my bomb and maybe even hit a target! Decided, accomplished. I wasn't able to determine where the bomb actually fell. In order to approach our targets with the correct glide angle, we applied lines on the sides of the canopy windows. As usual, improvising. In time, we achieved quite satisfactory results.

In 1967 I was invited to London for the 50th anniversary of the Royal Air Force. A former British fighter pilot asked me secretively, why in 1940 we had bombed the peninsula of Dungeness when there wasn't anything there worthwhile to bomb? After I explained to him that we had done our practice bombing there; he nodded understandingly.

We now began to fly with bombs against England, attacking various targets. Our first targets were the Biggin Hill airdrome and the Tilbury docks near London, where warships were being constructed. Soon, word got around that bombs were being dropped from Bf­109 equipped units. This resulted in the resumption of aerial combat.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><SKU>RB-017</SKU><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><XmlPackage>product.simplevariantformat.xml.config</XmlPackage><ColWidth>4</ColWidth><SalesPromptID>1</SalesPromptID><Published>1</Published><RequiresRegistration>0</RequiresRegistration><RelatedProducts></RelatedProducts><MiscText></MiscText><TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor>0</TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor><TrackInventoryBySize>0</TrackInventoryBySize><TrackInventoryByColor>0</TrackInventoryByColor><IsAKit>0</IsAKit><IsAPack>0</IsAPack><PackSize></PackSize><ImageFilenameOverride>dockyard-delivery_540.jpg</ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData><ProductVariant><Name>Limited Edition</Name><IsDefault>1</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-LE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With ONE co-signature.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>220</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>22x33</Dimensions><Inventory>250</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Artist's Proofs</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-AP</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With ONE co-signature.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>245</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>22x33</Dimensions><Inventory>20</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Remarqued Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-RE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With ONE co-signature.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>375</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>22x33</Dimensions><Inventory>20</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Studio Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-SE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>Signed by the artist only.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>160</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>22x33</Dimensions><Inventory>50</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant></Product><Product><Name>Dragon Slayers</Name><ProductTypeRef>Artist Print</ProductTypeRef><ManufacturerRef>Robert Bailey</ManufacturerRef><DistributorRef>Robert Bailey</DistributorRef><CategoryRef>/Aviation Art</CategoryRef><CategoryRef></CategoryRef><CategoryRef></CategoryRef><CategoryRef></CategoryRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><SectionRef></SectionRef><Summary></Summary><Description>Navy F-4 Phantoms and A­4 Skyhawks attack the Thanh Hoa bridge in North Vietnam. 104 pilots were shot down within a 75-square mile vicinity of this target.

Signatures

Signing these prints are aircrew who attacked the bridge some time during their tours of Vietnam. Two of the signees were shot down over the bridge, and survived almost six years of torture and imprisonment at the hands of the communists. Depicted is Phantom #201 flown by Fred Ferrazzano and later on the ill-fated flight by Ev Southwick and Jack Rollins.

Commander Fred J. Ferrazzano was involved in attacks on the Thanh Hoa bridge and flew Phantom 201 before Ev Southwick. During 1973 he ordered and implemented the mining of Haiphong Harbor, much to the surprise of President Nixon!

Captain Charles Everett (Ev) Southwick was the pilot of Phantom 201 when he was shot down over the Thanh Hoa bridge on May 14, 1967, with his back seater 'Jack' Rollins. He was a POW for nearly six years.

Commander David John (Jack) Rollins was Southwick's back seater in 201 when they were shot down over the Thanh Hoa bridge. He was a POW for nearly six years.

Commander Ron Stoddart also attacked the Thanh Hoa bridge. He flew a total of 98 missions over North Vietnam.

Captain Dan Arthur Pedersen was the Senior officer of the nine men who formed the now famous Navy Fighter Weapons School (Top Guns) at NAS Miramar. Pedersen accumulated 6100 flight hours and 1005 carrier landings, flying 39 various types of aircraft. (Signed first 50 prints of Limited Editions only.)

Commander John Tibbs is another attacker of the Thanh Hoa bridge and tlew two full deployments in 21 months of combat, about 50% being air to ground strikes. (Signed last 50 prints of Limited Editions, plus Artist's Proofs and Remarques).
The Story

It had stood for almost ten years against every conceivable ordinance that the Americans could muster via air power, surviving wave after wave of determined American airmen. For the North Vietnamese, it assumed a prominence that approached mythical status and became a symbol for the North of their determination, fortitude and cause.

Begun in 1957 and completed in 1964, it spanned the Ma River in the Annam province in North Vietnam. It did not die easily. Surrounded by what can only be described as the most hostile air space known to man, it was defended by every known defensive anti-aircraft weapon known, including surface to air missiles (SA-2's), AAA (up to 100mm) small arms fire and Migs at nearby airfields. The missions to Thanh Hoa bridge via Route Pack 4, became a veritable gauntlet that few combat pilots would relish. But these were not just ordinary men. They were determined men who supported each other and believed in a cause to defend the liberty and freedom of all people, including all of Vietnam and South East Asia. 104 American pilots were shot down within a 75 square mile vicinity of the target! The communists used the bridge to push Russian and Chinese supplies southward to the ground front by rail, truck and foot. Many airmen who survived being shot down would endure years of torture, mistreatment and malnourishment at the hands of their tormentors. They were housed in such infamous prisons as the 'Hanoi Hilton' while the biased world media believe that the POWs were being treated humanely.

Few people today ponder the hot action that occurred over the Thanh Hoa bridge. Fewer still know anything about it. But to the men and their families who endured, the memories of these valiant warriors stand as a testament to the noble and deeply rooted concepts of duty, honor and country.

Robert Bailey's latest painting depicts an attack scenario that was repeated many times. F-4 Phantoms fly flak suppression, targeting any and all who contest their arrival. Meanwhile, the A­4 Skyhawks deliver their carefully armed ordnance. Entering the target area at high speed, the pilots and their planes leave the bridge surrounded by an ever-expanding flak maelstrom in the hope that this will be the mission that will break the Dragon's Jaw and remove it from the dreaded target list.
The Thanh Hoa Bridge

By Gary W. Foster

The juxtaposition of American air might against the Thanh Hoa Bridge, fearfully known as the Ham Rong or Dragon's Jaw bridge, may become, if it hasn't already, the arch-symbol of the air war against the North Vietnamese. Destruction of the bridge became an intense obsession of American military planners. The Vietnamese, obsessing no less, fought to preserve the bridge, which for them had become the supreme symbol of their resistance to American air power. It's not without plausibility then that the destruction of this sacred symbol by the Americans may have been more important than the destruction of the structure itself.

A steel through-truss type structure, the Ham Rong Bridge, designed by Nguyen Dinh Doan, was principally a railway bridge with cantilevered roadways on each side of the main structure. In order to cross the Ma River at its narrowest point and because of limitations of the geometry of the railway curvature, the Ham Rong Bridge crosses the river almost due east-west. The general terrain in the immediate area of the bridge is flat with the exception of a jagged limestone ridge on the west side of the bridge known as Rong Mountain, and a small hillock on the east side known as Ngoc (Jade) Hill. The Ham Rong Bridge derives its name from these two geologic features that figuratively form the jaw bones of the dragon's mouth on either side of the river. Hence the English translation: "Dragon's Jaw."

The bridge depicted in "Dragon Slayers" is the second bridge to cross the Ma River at this location and was dedicated by Ho Chi Minh on May 19, 1964, the same day as his birthday. The first bridge was destroyed by the Viet Minh during the French resistance war many years before. As the air war in North Vietnam intensified, the Americans eventually divided North Vietnam into military regions called Route Packages which began at the Ben Hai River at the DMZ and were numbered one through six from south to north. With deadly portent, the Dragon's Jaw found itself in Route Package 4, assigned to the U.S. Navy, now its primary antagonist.

The Ham Rong Bridge was attacked throughout the war with intense alpha strikes from U.S. Navy carriers, occasional coordinated strikes by the USA Air Force and U.S. Navy, independent strikes of opportunity, and stand off attacks by missiles and by lobbing bombs. Navy pilots often dropped unexpended ordnance on the bridge or its environs before returning to their carriers. Under the direction of Nguyen Van Coi, commander of the air defense of North Vietnam, the Vietnamese positioned large numbers of every caliber of anti-aircraft weapon around the Ham Rong Bridge, atop Rong Mountain and Ngoc Hill, creating a formidable defensive curtain.

The Vietnamese made various claims as to how many American Planes were shot down while engaging the bridge or its air defenses. The numbers cited by the Vietnamese range between 99 to a preposterous high of 1000. One claim holds that in one day as many as thirty USA planes were shot down while striking the bridge. Although many American aircraft crashed in the area from other nearby actions or missions, historical records show only about 10 aircraft total were shot down while conducting missions directly against the bridge or its air defenses. While many planes continued to be shot down in and around Thanh Hoa throughout the war, LCDR Ev Southwick and his RIO, LT Jack Rollins, flying a flak suppression mission in an F-4 from VF­114 on the USS Kitty Hawk were, on May 14, 1967, the last American airmen to be shot down while striking the bridge or its air defenses. Captured just east of Thanh Hoa on the very banks of the Ma River, they became POW's in the Hanoi prison system and were released in 1973.

In all, the Americans flew about 1000 sorties against the bridge including two special attacks by USAF C-130's. Through "Dragon Slayers" Mr. Robert Bailey has vividly captured dramatic, poignant action with his definitive and timeless painting of an attack on the Thanh Hoa bridge in Route Package 4, North Vietnam that is representative of the myriad of attacks of that era on the bridge. The dreaded dragon finally met its fate in May of 1972 when laser guided bombs dropped from USAF F4s, dislodged the massive truss from its western abutment felling it into the muddy river below. The exuberance of the upper echelon planners remained unabated by this excellent result and additional attacks were planned and executed against the Ham Rong Bridge. On October 6, 1972, a flight of four A­4 aircraft, launched from a 27C Essex class aircraft carrier and escorted by flak suppression fighters and iron hand anti-SAM aircraft coordinated delivery of six two-thousand pound laser guided bombs on the structure effectively putting the Dragon's Jaw permanently out of commission.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>Navy F-4 Phantoms and A­4 Skyhawks attack the Thanh Hoa bridge in North Vietnam. 104 pilots were shot down within a 75-square mile vicinity of this target.

Sub Lieutenant Richard H. Kendall was a Royal Navy diver and member of a four-man crew on one of the midget submarines (called X-craft). These vessels were towed to Norway by a mother submarine and launched to sink the Tirpitz. After his boat's gyrocompass failed, his crew armed the sub's explosives. After scuttling the X-craft near the Tirpitz, he and his crew were taken prisoner aboard the battleship. They were all on board when the explosives detonated underneath the Tirpitz, crippling her for the duration of the war. He remained a prisoner until 1945. Richard Kendall received the DSO for this heroic attack.

Terje Jacobsen was a courageous young civilian in the Norwegian underground during the war. He was a messenger and was also responsible for reporting on the condition of the Tirpitz after one of the X-craft attacks. He and his mother were later discovered by German counter-intelligence and had to flee to neutral Sweden. He continued in Intelligence afterwards in England, returning to Norway at war's end.

Harry Haxby was trained as an aero engine fitter, but volunteered to be a Flight Engineer in the RAF. He joined 35 Squadron for his first tour of operations, and was awarded the DFM in 1942. By 1943, Harry was commissioned and completed his second tour with the Pathfinders. Two of his 48 missions were against the Tirpitz. He also flew Lord Tedder (Marshall of the RAF) to Yalta, prior to the conference of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin.

Alfred Zuba was a Midshipman aboard the Tirpitz for one month before its sinking, at the foremost firing control station. Although he survived, he was trapped for ten hours within the wreckage until rescued. The Tirpitz had capsized and he was pulled from a hole cut into the hull. Alfred was one of fewer than 90 of the rescued survivors, from a total of 1000 men on board when she was attacked by Lancasters.

Kurt Schulze flew night missions over England before being posted to JG­5, flying Me­109's from Northern Finland and Norway. In early 1945 he commanded 1/JG­51 in Gdansk, where he flew the last of 103 missions and ended the war commanding 13/JG­5 in Norway. Kurt was credited with 3 victories. He flew from Bardufoss, Norway, on November 12, 1944 when the Tirpitz was attacked by Lancasters off Tromsoe. He was scrambled too late to intercept the bombers.

Squadron Leader Tony Iveson was an RAF Spitfire pilot during the Battle of Britain and was shot down in the English Channel. He instructed pilots in Rhodesia and South Africa and afterwards joined 617 (Dambuster) Squadron, with which he flew on all three missions against the Tirpitz. The final mission sank the battleship with a 12,500 lb 'tallboy' bomb, designed to exceed the speed of sound at terminal velocity before penetrating the ship's deck.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>November 12, 1944.

Staff Sergeant Paul Zak is originally from Tourage, Lithuania. Trained at Army Air Field, Las Vegas, he joined 418 Squadron with the 100th Bomb Group. He flew with Harold Bucklew's crew in 'Silver Dollar,' as the ball turret gunner. On the Hamburg raid, he disabled a FW­190, causing its engine to catch fire. On the return journey, he witnessed Glenn Rojohn's B­17 collide with McNabb's, and both B­17's began a wide descending circle, drifting towards the coast. He reported the tail numbers at debriefing. Awards include Air Medal (5 OLC's), Polish Flying Cross, Russian Victory Medal.

Major Harry Crosby was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1942. He flew 37 missions, mostly as the Lead Navigator, including the longest missions to the north (Trondheim, Norway), east (Berlin, landing in Russia), and south (Regensburg, landing in North Africa). Decorations include DFC (three times), Air Medal (seven times), Bronze Star, two Presidential Citations and the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star (two times). He retired as a Lt. Colonel. He is also author of the book On a Wing and a Prayer.

1st Lieutenant 'Hong Kong' Wilson was born in Dublin, Texas. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and was trained in Prince Albert, (Saskatchewan), in Manitoba and at Prince Edward Island. After service flying over the North Atlantic, he joined the 100th Bomb Group and flew missions to Germany from England. On the Hamburg raid, 'Hong Kong' was leading the High Squadron, (B) with Major Harry Cruver as Command Pilot. They were flying deputy lead for the 100th BG that day. "Hong Kong's' Awards include the DFC and Air Medal.

Captain Glenn H. Rojohn was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He received his training in the eastern States, and was Pilot-in-Command of 'The Little Skipper' on the Hamburg raid with the 100th Bomb Group this day. After bombing the target and on the way home, another B­17 came up from underneath and collided with his aircraft. The two planes left the formation locked together, with Captain Rojohn controlling both planes with throttles. Some aircrew baled out, and Captain Rojohn crash-landed both aircraft on enemy territory. The Gestapo interrogated him for a few days, believing that he had commanded a new, 8-engined secret weapon. Awards include the DFC Air Medal, Purple Heart and POW Medal.

Major Charles A. Martin was born in Plaindealing, Louisiana, and trained at Randolph and Kelly Fields, Texas. He flew 8 combat missions over Germany in B­24's with the 458th BG before being transferred to the 100th BG as Commander of 349 Bomb Squadron.

Only Rosenthal and his crew in 'Royal Flush' returned to base at Thorpe Abbotts. During the Bremen raid, he was a 2nd Lieutenant. He went on to complete 52 missions and was on this third tour when the war ended. He was awarded sixteen decorations, including the DSC, Silver Star (twice), DFC (twice), Air Medal with Seven Clusters, two Purple Hearts and British and French decorations.

Another report says that a bomb dropped on 'Janie.' In any event, she went down, burning. Lt. Fienup tried to exit through the pilot's window, but became stuck. The aircraft then blew up, and he descended by parachute, becoming a POW. He has the DFC, ETO and Purple Heart.
Luftwaffe signatures:

Oberleutnant Walter Schuck joined the Luftwaffe in 1937. He scored his first victory while with 7./JG­5 based at Petsamo on the Polar Sea. On June 5., 1942, he shot down 4 Russian fighters. His rate of victories increased steadily. During March, 1944, he shot down 7 Boston bombers and by April had 84 victories. On June 15th he scored 6 more, and on the 17th, 12 more victories in 24 hours! By August he had 150. Later in the war he flew the Me­262 jet with JG­7. He shot down four B­17's in the 262, with 8 victories total on the jet. His all-up score was 206 confirmed aerial victories. His awards include the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.

Unteroffizier Heinz Kent was born in 1922 on a farm in the Taunus region of Germany. He was interested in aviation from his childhood on reading books about famous pilots like the Red Baron. After flying gliders, receiving his pilots licence (1943) and fighter pilot training, he flew the Me­109 and FW­190 in France, Austria, Finland and Norway. He owns a hotel north of Frankfurt where his old friends of JG­5 meet for their annual reunion.

Feldwebel Dieter Weinitschke was bora in 1920 in Berlin. He volunteered for the Luftwaffe in 1941 and was stationed in Finland with JG­5. He was soon recognized as an excellent fighter pilot in the Me­109. He also flew reconnaissance missions for Ju-87 and Ju-88 strikes against the Russian harbor of Murmansk. In 1942 he was shot down behind Russian lines, but three days later he was rescued by a Fiessler Storch. A year later he parachuted from his Me­109 and became a POW in Russia. He is credited with 19 victories. With his many poems and writings he still has a special place in the hearts of his old friends of the JG­5 Eismeerjager.

Leutnant Heinrich Freiherr van Podewils joined the Luftwaffe in 1939. He flew Me­109's and FW­190's in Bulgaria, Norway, Finland, and in the 'Home Defence' (Reichsverteidigung). His victories include a Hurricane, a B­17 and a Beaufighter. He was shot down twice, once over Germany by a P­47 Thunderbolt. In 1945 he commanded 8./JG­5 in Norway, where he became a POW of the Americans. He was turned over to the French. In January 1947, he escaped from a POW camp in France but was caught near the German border. He remained a prisoner in France until June 1947, two years after the end of the war.

Oberleutnant Ernst Scheufele was born in Walldorf, Germany. He joined the Luftwaffe in October 1940 and later flew the Me­109 with 4./JG­4, on 'Defense of the Reich1 missions. He also flew the Me­109 with JG­5 from Norway. On December 3, 1944, he was shot down by American ground fire near Aachen. He has a total of 18 victories, including three 4-engined bombers and two Mustangs. Ernst Scheufele flew 200 missions and holds the Frontflugspange in Gold.

Feldwebel Oscar Boesch joined the Luftwaffe in 1942. He volunteered for Sturm Staffel One, a special unit which attacked daylight four-engined bombers. During his first mission in April, 1944, he crash landed his FW­190, which flipped onto its back. He was shot down in May, but went on to score 18 victories, including a Spitfire, a Mustang, six B­17's, two B­24's, four IL­2's, two Lagg 5's and two Yak­9's. Oscar logged 120 combat missions, which ended in April 1945 when his FW­190 collided with a Yak­9 over Berlin. He was captured by the Russians, but escaped and walked 1000km back home to Austria.

The Story

America's entrance into war-torn Europe in 1942 was immediately at a strategic and tactical disadvantage. Germany had absorbed most of her neighbors into the Third Reich. Had it not been for England who stood defiant and largely alone, the scene that greeted the Americans would have been far more difficult. Europe by then was a fortress that had been carefully crafted by Germany's architects of war. The continent and coastline bristled defensively in an 'Atlantic Wall' that defied breaching.

To combat 'Fortress Europa,' America and England adopted an air war doctrine that was designed to soften up the expected German resistance and entrenchment, prior to the allied invasion. The heart of the air doctrine was centered on a bombing campaign that consisted of heavy bomber groups of both British and American design, that addressed both day and night bombing of industrial and population centers throughout the occupied territories. America chose to follow the philosophy of daylight precision bombing, which was inherently more dangerous than night bombing, exposing both aircraft and crews alike to the onslaught of German day fighters. The casualties experiences in 1942-1943 brought that philosophy to the brink of cancellation.

Yet the aircrews and bombers like the B­17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B­24 Liberator kept rising daily to do battle against the best that the Luftwaffe could muster. Time, effort and increased fighter escort proved to be the catalyst needed to change the picture of the air war. By the end of 1944, the Luftwaffe was losing ground to the mighty bomber streams that devastated their heartland.

In Robert Bailey's painting, FORMIDABLE FORTRESS, elements of the 100th Bomb Group are seen just after their bomb release above an oil refinery near Hamburg. Surprisingly, the aircrews reported no snow in or near the target area, even though it was the end of December. The mission lacked fighter cover, which had been diverted to another B­17 raid that day. The 'Bloody Hundredth' were attacked by Fw-190's, Me­109's and Me­262 jets. The fighters had been vectored to the scene by a captured B­17 flown by the Germans, who monitored the bomber stream, reporting height, speed and heading. The Hundredth lost 12 planes this day, but they had destroyed their target and then thundered home with an abiding faith in their fellow crew members and their formidable Fortresses.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>December 31, 1944.

Sqn Leader Don LaubmanFrom D­Day to VE-Day, thirteen RCAF Fighter pilots in service on the continent accounted for more than 120 German aircraft destroyed. Top scorer was Squadron Leader Don Laubman of 412 Squadron (and later 402 Squadron), with fifteen victories.

On September 26 and 27, 1944, Don Laubman flew four missions and downed seven enemy aircraft in the Nijmegan area (four FW­190's and three BF­109's) plus another BF­109 damaged. During this period and along with his squadron mates, Don was heavily involved in air to ground action. This involved bombing and strafing of marshalling yards and targets of opportunity, such as trains, barges and vehicles. On his last mission he attacked two fuel tenders traveling down a dirt road. He first shot at the rear vehicle, observed strikes, and lined up with the second truck which also received hits. But as he passed over at low level, they exploded in a massive fireball which engulfed his Spitfire and he had to bail out. He was then nearly lynched by German civilians but spent the rest of the war as a POW.

All of his victories were scored in Spitfire VZZ. He ended the war as a Squadron Leader with fifteen victories. Decorations included the DFC and Bar. He is the fourth ranking RCAF ace, retiring as a Lt. General.

F/O Gordon Ockenden joined the RCAF in 1941, trained on the Fleet Finch and Harvard, and won his wings a year later. After operational training on Hurricanes he was posted to Europe in 1943 with 443 (F) Squadron, 144 Wing. This was the first Wing to move into France, on June 15, 1944. During the Falaise Gap period, Gord was credited with over 35 German vehicles and tanks destroyed. He is credited with 4­1/2 aerial victories. The Mk. IXb Spitfire which Gordon Flew at this time was 21­V. It was reclaimed from salvage, rebuilt by RAF St. Athans, Wales, and now flies with the RAF. Memorial Flight from Coningsby. He retired from the air force as a Major General. Between June and December of 1944, Gordon did most of his ops on another Spitfire, MJ­171. During a dawn patrol he had a rough time, so another pilot offered to take his place on the dusk mission. All of the planes failed to return. Gordon feels as though he has been on borrowed time since then.

F/O Don Murchie joined the RCAF in 1941, training on Tiger Moths and Cessna Cranes. Posted to Bournemouth, England, he was selected for day fighters and had further training on Miles Masters and Hurricanes. Selected for Spitfires, he eventually ended up with 412 Squadron. He was involved in dive bombing and armed reconnaissance flights in the Ruhr areas, as well as fighter sweeps throughout the air space east of the Rhine River. Don flew over 80 operational sorties and is credited with numerous ground vehicles, locomotives and motorcycles destroyed.

F/O Douglas Gaudin enlisted in the RCAF In 1940 and received operational training on Hurricanes at Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire, England. He was posted to 122 Squadron RAF on Spitfires at Scorton, Yorkshire in February 1942, then later transferred to the Middle East via West Africa. He then joined 417 Squadron RCAF in October 1942 at a base near Alexandria, flying Hurricanes and, later, Spitfires. The main task of the squadron at this time was the defence of Alexandria Harbour prior to Montgomery's advance, and the interception of German photo reconnaissance aircraft. Douglas is credited with nearly a hundred operational sorties.
The Story

Immediately following the Normandy breakout by the allies in late July of 1944, the German army was in a full and disorganized retreat. The combined allied war machine was beginning to push the Wehrmacht across the length and breadth of France. This was accomplished in large part by dominating the air space above the conflict. The air campaign of Great Britain and the United States had wrestled air superiority from the German Luftwaffe in the years 1942-1944. It was now paying big dividends.

Without control of the air, the German army was denied the freedom to move troops and equipment to combat the advancing allied effort. Deployment of German troops was inevitably defensive in nature, and they were constantly harassed by marauding fighter bombers and reconnaissance flights.

No movement was safe, including the travels of high echelon superiors in the military as they scurried about the battle front, attempting to analyze the changing situation and adjust their plans.

In Robert Bailey's painting FULL THROTTLE, a German staff car, escorted by motorcycles, is caught on an open road by Spitfires searching for targets of opportunity. In this case, a locomotive transporting war materials makes this a double bonus target.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>Spitfires of 412 Squadron, RCAF, attack targets of opportunity in France just after D­Day.</SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><SKU>RB-023</SKU><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><XmlPackage>product.simplevariantformat.xml.config</XmlPackage><ColWidth>4</ColWidth><SalesPromptID>1</SalesPromptID><Published>1</Published><RequiresRegistration>0</RequiresRegistration><RelatedProducts></RelatedProducts><MiscText></MiscText><TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor>0</TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor><TrackInventoryBySize>0</TrackInventoryBySize><TrackInventoryByColor>0</TrackInventoryByColor><IsAKit>0</IsAKit><IsAPack>0</IsAPack><PackSize></PackSize><ImageFilenameOverride>full-throttle_540.jpg</ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData><ProductVariant><Name>Limited Edition</Name><IsDefault>1</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-LE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With FOUR co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>220</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>22.5x33.5</Dimensions><Inventory>400</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Artist's Proofs</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-AP</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With FOUR co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>245</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>22.5x33.5</Dimensions><Inventory>40</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Special Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-SE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With FOUR co-signatures.

The Story

In the summer of 1972, A-4 Skyhawks and A6 Intruders complete an Alpha Strike, laying MK 2 and DST Destructor mines in the approach to Haiphong Harbor, North Vietnam. U.S. Navy aircraft launched from several carriers in the Northern Gulf of Tonkin laid thousand of mines in the harbor during this period. The international shipping at Haiphong were unloading tons of munitions which were going down the Ho Chi Min Trail to be used against U.S. Forces in the south. These mining strikes put an effective stop to such enemy activity.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>In the summer of 1972, A-4 Skyhawks and A6 Intruders complete an Alpha Strike, laying MK 2 and DST Destructor mines in the approach to Haiphong Harbor, North Vietnam.

Horst PetzschlerHorst Petzschler had a distinguished career with the Luftwaffe during World War II. His first victory was a Soviet Yak­7, shot down in November 1943. He became an ace on May 12, 1944, when he downed a B­17 and a P­51 near Frankfurt-am-Main. By war's end, he had 22 Soviet victories to his credit, in addition to two American P­51s, a B­24 Liberator, and a B­17 Flying Fortress.

Petzschler was awarded the Day Fighter Operational Flying Clasp (Gold) in March of 1944 to mark his completion of 110 operational flights. By the end of the war he held the Iron Cross Second and First Class. On May 4, 1945, Petzschler, now a Feldwebel, landed his Bf­109 at Bulltofta Airport in Sweden. Flying now with 10/JG­51, he intended to fly to Copenhagen, but navigational error brought him to Bulltofta instead. He was interned until January, 1946 and handed over to the Russians. He remained a Soviet prisoner until 1949. His last Bf­109 of the fastest type Messerschmitt to see service, was ground looped by a Soviet pilot during a test flight, and subsequently scrapped. Emmigrating to America after his release, he lived in California, and presently resides in Kansas.

Oscar BoeschOscar Boesch also had a distinguished career with the Luftwaffe. After narrowly avoiding death on his first mission on April 29, 1944, he claimed his first victory on May 8. Wounded several times in his 12 month as an operational flyer, he lost eight FW­190's. His victories included a Spitfire, a Mustang, six B­17s, two B­24s and eight Soviet aircraft.

After completing 120 operational sorties, his aircraft collided with a Yak-9 over Berlin, during the last days of the war. He was captured by the Russians after baling out, but escaped and walked 1000km to his native home in Austria.

In 1951, Oscar Boesch emmigrated to Canada with his wife Editha and baby Roland. The Boesch's have had two daughters since then. Oscar still flies at airshows across North America, and has appeared in the IMAX movie, Silent Flight.
The Story

May 28, 1944 — On this day, American bombers concentrated their attacks on German oil targets. A record force of 1282 heavy bombers was dispatched, accompanied by 1200 escort fighters, and mounted strikes on a variety of targets. American strategy called for the leading bomb wings to hit other important targets in the vicinity of the oil facilities, as a ruse. The plan worked. Thirteen combat wings of American bombers suffered no losses at all to enemy aircraft.

The Luftwaffe did, however, have 300 fighters waiting for the leading wings over Magdeburg, and these Fortresses were hit hard. One of the German pilots was Feldwebel Horst Petzschler of 2/JG­3, flying at high altitude with Feldwebel Oscar Boesch. Homing in on the American aircraft, Petzschler managed to shoot down a P­51 at approximately 12:20 PM. Very recent investigation has revealed that this was most likely the aircraft of Captain Woodward (Woody) Anderson of 486 Fighter Squadron, 352nd Fighter Group. In all, 40 American aircraft were lost during the day's raids.

Petzschler's Messerschmitt Bf­109G 6­AS was also damaged during the fight and he had to bale out of his aircraft during this engagement. The Leica gun camera in the left wingtip was later salvaged from the wreck. The rest of the aircraft was destroyed on impact with the ground. Petzschler consequently had to wait some time before his P­51 could be confirmed.

'Horrido!' is a graphic portrayal of this epic battle, placing Petzschler and Boesch above the bomber stream, with the latter turning and diving for the initial attack. Petzschler has seen the P­51s, and is banking to engage. His aircraft was notable for the light camouflage paint it wore for the high altitude role it served. Coincidentally, both of these pilots flew the same numbered aircraft this day: Black 14.

'Horrido' was the Luftwaffe fighter pilots' war cry.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>May 28, 1944.

Lt. Robert H. JacksonHal Jackson joined one of the most successful of all U.S. Navy Fighting Squadrons in WWII, on January 1, 1943: VF­17. He served with it on two tours of duty until it was decommissioned in April 1944. VF­17 became known as the 'Skull and Crossbones' squadron after having adopted the old pirates' ensign of the Jolly Roger as their insignia.

During April 1945, Hal Jackson was with VBF­10 aboard the carrier Intrepid, when he was involved in the Yamato strike. He is credited with shooting down 1 Japanese Betty bomber and 3 Zekes, besides dropping a bomb on the battleship Yamato.

Lt. Jackson was known as the 'Nightwatchman of the Wardroom,' owing to his completely bohemian existence amid the otherwise regimented life aboard ship. Never on the flight deck except to take off, the only way he know whether it was night or day was by activity in the wardroom.

His decorations include 2 Distinguished Flying Crosses; 8 Air Medals, Silver Star (for role in helping sink the Yamato); World War II Victory Medal; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal; Navy Unit Commendation. He currently lives in Denton, Texas, with his wife Barbara. He practices criminal law.

AircrewIn the closing months of the pacific war, Japan was becoming more desperate in the defence of her homeland. The armed forces of Japan had developed more fanatical strategies to thwart the approaching USA war machine. The Imperial Japanese Navy was not immune from this, even though the diminished fleet was but a remnant of its former self. Thus, in April of 1945, the fate of the Yamato task group was sealed in a sacrificial plan to reinforce the defenders of Okinawa.

With only enough fuel to make the voyage from the Inner Sea of Japan to the island, under assault from the combined American and Allied Forces, the world's largest battleship, together with the light cruiser Yahagi and eight escort destroyers, sailed into the South China Sea. They were tracked by USA submarines through the Bungo Straits, their positions being relayed to USA Task Force 58. There would be no air cover for the Japanese Navy.

At approximately half past noon on April 7, 1945, more than 380 USA planes from Task Group 58 attacked the Yamato Task Group in three separate air waves. In the ensuing battle that lasted a little more than three hours, the Imperial Japanese Navy ceased to exist. Sunk was the battleship Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and four of the eight escort destroyers. The remaining destroyers limped home to Kure Harbor with what survivors they could find from the sunken ships.

The sacrifice for the Japanese was staggering. In addition to the Japanese Navy's loss of pride, 4250 officers and sailors perished. The loss to American forces were 10 planes and 12 aircrew.

Admiral Isoroku Yamamato, the architect who had planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, had predicted this outcome at the beginning of hostilities more than three and a half years prior to this tragic battle. The giant did indeed awaken and returned with a terrible resolve. It would culminate four months later not far from where the keel for the Yamato was laid: Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>April 7, 1945.

Harry Crosby was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1942 and served two years overseas with the 100th Bomb Group. He flew 37 missions, mostly as the Lead Navigator. He was the task force lead navigator on the Bremen mission. Decorations include DFG (three times), Air Medal (seven times), Bronze Star, two Presidential Citations and Croix de Guerre with Silver Star (two times).

General Tom Jeffrey was assigned to the 100th Bomb Group in May 1944 as Officer Commanding. His rank at the time of the Bremen mission was Major, although he retired as a Lieutenant Major General. Among the missions he flew were Rostok, Berlin, Stutgart, Schweinfurt and two Russian shuttle missions. Decorations include DSM, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, and Croix de Guerre.

'Cowboy' Owen Roane flew 10 missions before being given the position of Lead Pilot. After 10 more missions he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant for a total of 28 missions. On the Bremen mission, he was a Flying Officer. During his tour of duty in the European theatre, he never aborted a mission. Decorations include DFC with Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters, Presidential Citation with two Oak Leaf Clusters.

Robert Rosenthal enlisted on December 8, 1941, and joined the 100th Bomb Group in the fall of 1943 as a pilot. On his third mission, 'Rosie' flew the only B­17 ('Royal Flush') to return to Thorpe Abbotts from the Munster raid. At the time of the Bremen mission, he was a 2nd Lieutenant. Rosenthal completed 52 missions and went on to become an Assistant Prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials. Decorations include DFC, DSC, Silver Star, and Air Medal with seven clusters.

The Story

detailBy 04:00 on the morning of October 8, 1943, the departments of Group Photo, Armament, Signals, Ordnance, Navigation, Transportation, Weather, and Flying Control had been notified of the impending mission. The men were awakened at 07:00. After breakfast and briefing, engines were started at 11:30. The first B­17 of the Lead Squadron took off at 11:43. This was 'Our Babe,' depicted crossing the field at about fifteen hundred feet in Robert Bailey's painting 'Men of The Century.' With her is a no-name B­17. As men stand anxiously on the Thorpe Abbotts control tower, 'Holy Terror,' (right) 'Queen Bee' and 'Marie Helena' taxi past. 'Marie Helena' was to collide with a FW­190 on this mission.

This limited edition print is to honor all those men, both in aircrew and groundcrew, who have made the 'Bloody Hundredth' a living legend.
The Hundredth Bomb Group

Little remains as evidence of the size, scope and activity that occurred at Thorpe Abbotts less than sixty years ago. The calmness of the countryside and few remaining dilapidated structures belie the titanic struggle that occurred at this former Eighth Air Force Heavy Bomber base that housed the famous 'Bloody Hundredth.'

Then, young men who grew older than their years, faced an enemy in the air whom at times decimated their ranks. Yet time and time again, the men and machines rose to do battle high in the stratosphere, deep into the heartland of Nazi Germany.

Inevitably, they would face the onslaught of other young men in enemy fighters, accurate flak, and the elements of nature that would conspire to reduce the average life expectancy of the bomber crews to as few as six missions. The goal of twenty five missions to qualify for rotation back to the zone of the interior, appeared to be impossible to achieve. These were hard, dark days that greeted the Americans who joined in the fight for freedom and democracy with their British counterparts.

The names of the targets became legend, as did the men who participated in the missions. Regensburg, Schweinfurt, and Bremen. To those who remember the air war, those names evoke a terror and reverence that only they can know.

Now, only the wind blows across the empty fields at Thorpe Abbotts and other former air bases in England. But to those who flew there during those former times, the ground remains sacred and is seared into their memories.

The 100th Bomb Group built a proud heritage in those years that stands today upon duty, personal sacrifice and honor. They would be among the first to admit that they were only doing what was called of them to do. But the record still proudly stands. They completed their assigned tasks, though they were bloodied in the conflict.

The Story

The city lay dark and silent under the muffling blanket of January snow. Flakes swirled and danced in their countless millions, sparkling underneath the amber glow of street lamps, finally ending their long descent by clinging to roofs, fences, roads and fields. Vehicles plowed sluggishly through the rutted streets, and only the odd warmly clad figure could be seen hurrying home, perhaps to a hot drink with their Sunday evening supper.

1954 had been a particularly bad winter for the east coast of England, but the trains through Yarmouth's Longport railway station were still running on time. Passengers sat huddled on wood benches inside the typically spartan British Railways waiting room, warming hands against the meagre gas fire and conversing in low tones. The stationmaster, a portly, aged fellow who had spent most of his life on the railway, stepped onto the wind-swept platform, deftly removed his watch from a vest pocket and compared it to the large clock overhead. It was getting on to 8 o'clock and the 'Queen of Scots' would be due in a few minutes.

With a practiced hand he lit his tarnished oil lamp and swinging it as he walked, made his way acrossthe rail lines to the fence that bordered the road. Directing its beam to the rails, he grunted with satisfaction and moved on.

Approaching the arches of the old Victorian Dimsdale Bridge, he was momentarily blinded by the headlights of a car he recognized as an antiquated Rolls Royce. Throwing spray to either side, it pulled off and parked beside the station fence, immediately disgorging five occupants, who immediately began an animated conversation.

There were three women, one of whom appeared to be in her teens. She stalked away from the group, kicking up the snow. One of the other women had taken out a handkerchief and began to sob uncontrollably. "I just don't want to say goodbye, Stephen," she cried.

The taller of the two men, a gaunt looking figure wearing a Fedora and clutching a suitcase, looked away down the road, his expression twisting in pain. "Belinda, please...you must understand that it's God's work I must do first. I'll be back for you."

"Two years is a long time," she responded, her voice blurred with emotion.

"Stephen, I'm asking you to reconsider," said the third woman, a tall blonde. "There are hospitals here, people who just as dearly need your surgeon's skills."

"You must understand," Stephen replied. "Where I'm going, they don't even have the basics of life. I must go where I'm called."

"Well, I'm calling you," the young woman answered, throwing her arms around him. He dropped his suitcase and embraced her tenderly. They clung to each other and she saw the anguish in his expression. "Don't do this," her eyes pleaded. But then she could not suppress a shudder as she noticed a shadow pass briefly across his face, and she knew he was resolute.

Slowly and gently he withdrew, and picking up his suitcase, strode quickly to the end of the fence, crossed the rail line and ascended the platform.

Just at that moment, the sounds of an approaching locomotive could be heard, and within seconds steamed into view through the swirling snow flurries on the other side of the arched bridge.

The stationmaster, meanwhile, had moved off down the line. As the train pulled into the station with a clattering of iron and bellowing of steam, he looked up at the passengers sitting in the compartments, reading newspapers or peering through the windows.

The little group beside the car had fallen silent. The teenage girl still stood beside the road, looking on as the taller woman took out her handkerchief and wiped a tear away. The driver was leaning on the Rolls, seemingly forlorn. Belinda had gripped the top of the fence, her head bowed in defeat.

The gaunt man with the suitcase had paused, facing them across the track. He lifted a hand in silent farewell.

"Wait!" called Belinda, looking up, her whole body shaking. "Wait! Stephen!"

From where he was standing, peering through the clouds of smoke and steam, Stephen could barely see her waving at him. It wasn't as if he was leaving his own family behind. It was Belinda's family, after all. He had asked her to marry him, and marry her he would, if she saw fit to wait for him. It would be a trial for them both. He would be in the tropics of Africa, but he'd be thinking of her. If her love for him was not true, she would find another man, and then he would know the truth. He turned to go.

"Wait! I love you! I want you to know I'll wait!" Belinda shouted to him, her voice lost in a sudden burst of pressurized steam from the locomotive. Her taller companion waved her handkerchief in desperation, but Stephen's form wavered and disappeared amidst the backlit clouds of vapor. Then he was gone.

Belinda turned suddenly with her back to the fence and buried her face in her hands.

"Maybe it's best this way," said the driver kindly. "At least, for now."

The two women clung to each other and with a giant gasp, the train began to slowly pull away. Stephen was at the carriage window, but they could not see the tear spring to his eye, nor see the slight trembling of his lip as the train pulled them farther and farther apart. As the rear lights of the carriages disappeared into the mist, the old stationmaster ascended the platform, glanced at the clock and watched as the Rolls reversed out into the road and slowly moved away, leaving only its tire tracks and a little cluster of footprints to mark where it had been.

The snow continued falling, and in a little while, even these fleeting impressions had disappeared, just as utterly as if they had never existed.

Signatures

Signed by four RCAF Mosquito pilots. Comes with bio-card, showing photos and biographies of signees.

Flight Lieutenant D. W. Schmidt joined the RCAF in 1941. He attended OTU in Britain before joining 236 Squadron as a Coastal Command Beaufighter pilot. Sixteen days later he was with a ferry unit at Lyneham, testing Beaufighters. During that year he was posted to Malta to join 227 Squadron. In six sorties he claimed eight aircraft. He also scored many hits on Italian shipping. At war's end he was in the UK with 404 Coastal Mosquito squadron. He holds the DFC and Bar.

Warrant Officer 1st Class Stanley G. Reynolds joined the RCAF in 1942 at the age of 18. In June 1943, after receiving his pilots wings, he was posted to England. After training on Blenheims and Beaufighters, he was sent with his navigator to Scotland. In June of 1944 he was posted to 410 Squadron where he made 35 flights in Mosquitos. Stan was awarded a wound stripe for injuries received on active service, and is a member of the renowned 'Guinea Pig Club.'

Flight Lieutenant Marie Wright (nee Sylvester) began her flying career at the tender age of sixteen and a half. She earned her wings with the RCAF after training on a variety of aircraft. Marie was eventually posted to Hornchurch Station near London, England. Mosquitos are among the 65 different types she flew in the ATA which was a part of Tactical Air Command. She flew aircraft to and from many stations in England and, after D­Day, in France. She has a particular fondness for the de Havilland Mosquito.

Flight Lieutenant J. H. (Jack) Reilly joined the RCAF in 1940 and served in Canada, Alaska and overseas until 1946. He flew Mosquitos on high-level operations and has 30,000 hours on 70 different types of aircraft. During the war he flew B­24's and Sunderlands on operations. On flight test duties, he flew Corsairs, Spitfires and Hurricanes. He maintains his Airline Transport Pilot's licence and still flies today.
The Story

One of the truly remarkable aeronautical developments of World War II occurred during Britain's darkest hours in 1940. With the Battle of France lost, Dunkirk evacuated, and the Battle of Britain about to commence, aircraft development was not a top priority. Constrained by the use of non-strategic materials, the de Havilland Mosquito was born.

Constructed of molded plywood and metal, this radical-concept twin engine airplane surpassed everyone's expectations. Initially envisioned as a bomber, it quickly filled the roles of long-range photo reconnaissance, mine-layer, pathfinder, and high speed military transport.

But it was in the fighter role for both day and night that this high speed aircraft (378 mph) excelled. Its long range, exceptional fire power and payload capacity made it into a highly versatile and successful war plane.
The de Havilland Mosquito

Fitted with radar and assisted by ground control intercept (code named 'Starlight') the famous Mosquito proved particularly potent against raiding German aircraft at night. The interdiction forays into British airspace during the early 1940's by the FW­190 and twin engine types, were seeking 'targets of opportunity.'

In Robert Bailey's second Night Combat painting MOONLIGHT STRIKE, a Mosquito of 264 Squadron, RAF, has been vectored toward an enemy raider, and the on-board radar operator has directed the pilot upon the unsuspecting aircraft. The FW­190 carries a 500kg bomb that will not find a target on British soil tonight. Instead, the Lufwaffe pilot will be lucky to survive the bale out from his airplane that is engulfed in flame after suffering the blistering fire from the attacking Mosquito's 20mm fusillade.

The successful missions which the Mosquitos completed have become legend, just as the crews who flew them.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>An RAF Mosquito of 264 Squadron destroys a FW­190 over London, England during 1943.</SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><SKU>RB-029</SKU><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><XmlPackage>product.simplevariantformat.xml.config</XmlPackage><ColWidth>4</ColWidth><SalesPromptID>1</SalesPromptID><Published>1</Published><RequiresRegistration>0</RequiresRegistration><RelatedProducts></RelatedProducts><MiscText></MiscText><TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor>0</TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor><TrackInventoryBySize>0</TrackInventoryBySize><TrackInventoryByColor>0</TrackInventoryByColor><IsAKit>0</IsAKit><IsAPack>0</IsAPack><PackSize></PackSize><ImageFilenameOverride>moonlight-strike_540.jpg</ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData><ProductVariant><Name>Limited Edition</Name><IsDefault>1</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-LE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With FOUR co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>220</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>23.5x34</Dimensions><Inventory>300</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Artist's Proofs</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-AP</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With FOUR co-signatures.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>245</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>23.5x34</Dimensions><Inventory>30</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Remarqued Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-RE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With FOUR co-signatures.

Signatures

1st Lieutenant Arval 'Robie' Roberson was born in Crown Point, Indiana. His service career began as an Aviation Cadet in 1942 in the Army Air Corps and lasted for 31 years. He held various staff and command positions and performed combat duty in three conflicts: World War II (76 missions in ETO - Passion Wagon, six and a half enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed, and one probable); Korea: (100 missions - F-51) and Vietnam (26 missions - C-47). Decorations include DFC with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters; Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal with OLC, Air Medal with 15 OLC's, Presidential Citation with OLC, French Croix de Guerre with Palm, Vietnamese Medal of Honor, and the Russian Medal of the Great Patriotic War. He retired as a Colonel.

1st Lieutenant Bill Dunlop joined the 357th in June, 1944 and flew combat missions until January 1945 at which time he was shot down. He spent the last 4 months of his duty in a POW camp. Bill had 4 victories. Decorations include: DFC, Air Medal with 8 OLC's, the Purple Heart, and the Presidential Unit Citation.

1st Lieutenant 'Chuck' Weaver joined the 357th Fighter Group as a replacement pilot in July 1944. For his first combat encounter on September 19th of that year, he flew as Arval Roberson's wingman. When Arval left the 357th, Chuck Weaver took over 'Passion Wagon' and her ground crew. Chuck finished the war with a tally of 8 victories, with 1 probable and 1 damaged. He had a total of 73 missions and became the Squadron Operations Officer. He was awarded the DFC with Cluster, Air Medal with 16 OLC's, Presidential Citation and Croix de Guerre.

1st Lieutenant Harve Mace joined 362 Fighter Squadron, 357th Fighter Group, as a 2nd Lieutenant in late June 1943. He flew 69 combat missions, including the second shuttle mission. Harve downed three Me­109's while flying escort for the bombers. He rose to Captain and was awarded the DFC and Air Medal with six Oak Leaf Clusters. He served briefly as Operations Officer for the Squadron before being bumped to 3rd Bomb Division Headquarters as Fighter Controller. He also flew one combat mission as observer on a B­17 and checked out as PIC on the B­17. Harve returned home to his new war bride in 1945.

1st Lieutenant Raymond 'Ted' Conlin enlisted in the Army Air Corps in July of 1942 and graduated as a fighter pilot in November 1943 at Luke Field, Arizona. In April 1944 he was assigned to the 357th Fighter Group, 362 Squadron. Ted took part in 71 combat missions, including D­Day, Normandy, the second Russian shuttle from Europe and the massive air and ground battle known as Market Garden. He later became a flight leader and was awarded the DFC, Air Medal with 4 OLC's, 4 theatre Battle Stars and the Russian Medal of the Great Patriotic War.

The 'Yoxford Boys' scored the second most air victories (595) in the 8th Air Force, had the most enemy aircraft destroyed in air combat in one day (55.5), most enemy jet aircraft (Me­262's) destroyed in air combat (18.5), was the fastest scoring fighter group during the last year of the war, and had 42 aces!
Special Guest Signature on Artist's Proofs

Captain 'Bud' Anderson was another original pilot from the 357th Fighter Group who trained at Tonopah, Nevada, before deploying to the ETO and flying P­51's from Leiston. Bud completed two combat tours with the 357th, and at war's end had 16 1/4 confirmed victories. He became a test pilot and later served in the Vietnam conflict.

The Story

With the success of Operation Cobra on July 27, 1944, and the Normandy breakout in full swing, the German army retreat began in earnest. This had been accomplished in no small measure by employing the strategic and tactical air doctrines of the air forces of Britain and the United States with the allied ground forces. The result was air supremacy and control over the battlefield of Normandy and France.

detailThe tactical missions of the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces supported the advancing allied armies through a network of FAC's (Forward Air Controllers), that would work directly with ground echelons on the advance. Air strikes terrorized the German armor and ground forces, and few encounters between the fighters and fighter bombers came out in favor of the Germans. Throughout the daylight hours of August and September of 1944, these attacks hounded and paralyzed the supply lines and logistics of the enemy. Moving war material and troops at night under the cloak of darkness offered one of the few opportunities for the Germans to make any progress. Few targets escaped the punishing attacks of these fighters, who used their bombs, rockets and .50 caliber machine guns to pulverize the surprised Germans. The level of intensity of these attacks were such that 56 years later, surviving German soldiers still speak in hushed tones of the ferocity of fighter attacks and the feelings of hopelesness and fear that became increasingly an everyday occurrence.

In Robert Bailey's painting, MUSTANG MENACE, just such a scenario unfolds. A German tank column moving to the front has had the unfortunate luck to cross paths with a Kriegslok train carrying petro chemicals. Alerted by an FAC, fighters of the 357th Fighter Group attack with a vengeance at the target-rich environment. The ensuing conflagration is just another day on the job for the 357th.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>Late August 1944.

Robert puts the human figures in last; this is because he needs to know the color of light which has to fall on them, and because the position of lights in the railyard determines where the shadows from the figures will fall. These were all live models who dressed up in military uniforms for this project. Looks pretty bare without the troops, doesn't it? Of course, the airplane has to go in, too.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>A Dornier 217 of KG­2 overflies a railway station somewhere in southern England during the early part of WWII.

Commander Randy 'Duke' Cunningham is one of the most highly decorated pilots of the Vietnam war. He completed two combat cruises with Fighter Squadron 96 aboard the USS America and the USS Constellation. He flew a total of 300 combat missions over North Vietnam and Laos.

On January 19, 1972, Cunningham engaged three Mig-17's north of Quang Lang Airfield and shot down the lead aircraft. On May 8, 1972, he engaged three Mig-17's and destroyed the Mig that was chasing his wingman, while he himself was being fired at by two other aircraft. On May 10, 1972, in one of the most famous air battles in history, Cunningham was on a flack-supression mission south of Hanoi. While pulling off the target, his flight was attacked by 22 Mig­17's, Mig­19's and Mig­21's. During this fight, he shot down three of the 22 Migs, giving him a total of FIVE victories and qualifying him as the first 'Ace' of Vietnam, a feat that only one other pilot accomplished during the entire Vietnam war! In one of these victories, he shot down a Mig­17 from his executive officer's tail while being directly attacked by four Mig­17's, four Mig­21's and two Mig­19's. For this action, 'Duke' Cunningham was nominated for the prestigious Medal of Honor. After his third victory of the day, he turned to the sanctuary of the Gulf of Tonkin, but was hit by a surface-to-air missile, forty miles over enemy territory.

He has been decorated with the Navy Cross, two Silver Starts, 15 Air Medals, three Navy Commendation Medals, the Purple Heart, a Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Unit Commendation Medal, a South Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry (Star Cluster) and Cross of Gallantry Oak Leaf. Cunningham was also wrote a book, Fox Two, about his experiences, and was an instructor at Top Gun, the Navy Fighter Weapons School at NAS Miramar in San Diego. Many of his experiences as a navy pilot were depicted in the movie Top Gun.
The Story

The war in Vietnam cannot be compared to any previous war, with perhaps the exception of the conflict in Korea ten years earlier. It is there that the Rules of Engagement (ROE) began, and caused the effectiveness of American military power to deteriorate. In Vietnam, the politicians took these Rules of Engagement to a new and absurd height, making the day-to-day battle decisions that formerly were the job of military personnel. It was the military who had the expertise. Instead, battle goals were made unattainable, with the result of losing not only men, morale and material, but protracted the conflict for years.

The air war in Vietnam was not immune to this dangerous meddling by non-military planners. Targets that pilots were allowed to strike, often had no military value whatsoever, while key strike areas were forbidden, as they were too sensitive for world and public opinion. Fighting a battle where control of the battlefield was taken away from the military, spelled a stalemate at best.

The pilots knew this, as it became all too apparent in the daily sorties flown by the Navy, Marines and Air Force. Despite this situation, they still carried out their duties with precision and dedication as they flew in harm's
way to the fortified sites they were occasionally allowed to target. Missions to North Vietnam in particular posed serious threats to aircraft and crews. There were defensive batteries of triple-A's, SAMS, and an array of intensive anti-aircraft screens that few flight crews had ever seen before. A trip to Hanoi, Hai Phong Harbor or any of the other major North Vietnam targets was an exercise in faith by the men who flew the missions, by the ground crews, and by the rescue crews who would many times jeopardize their own safety to pick up downed flyers.

Robert Bailey's intensely dramatic painting, NIGHT OF THE PHANTOMS, shows a pair of F-4B Phantoms from the USS Ranger (CVA­61) exiting their assigned target (Hai Phong Harbor) at 400 knots, having expended their 5-inch Zuni rocket packs. Their efforts have paid off by destroying an AA site, munitions storage facilities and sinking two surface vessels. Fire-walling the aircraft, the pilots and their RIO's take the necessary evasive action in anticipation of the NVA anti-aircraft response. With their feet wet, they head for home, to the relative safety of their carrier battle group, satisfied at the outcome of the mission and the night's work.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>May 6, 1966.

Walter Schuck was born on July 30, 1920 and joined the Luftwaffe in 1937. By December 1940 he was an Unteroffizier in JG­3. In January of 1942 he was transferred to 7/JG­5. By April of that year he was at Petsamo on the Polar Sea Front and it was here, on May 15th, that he scored his first victory. On June 5th he shot down four Russian fighters. After that, his progress was steady. By April 14th he had 31. After another two months, he added a further 13 aircraft and then received the German Cross in Gold.

On March 17, 1944, he brought down seven Boston bombers, with another 5 victories on April 7th. His total was then 84, for which he received the Knight's Cross the following day. On May 25th and 26th he shot down another 10 aircraft and then on June 15th, another further 6 successes brought his total to the magic 100.

Two days later, he had his most successful day (never surpassed by any other JG­5 pilot) when he scored 12 victories in 24 hours! On the 27th and 28th of the same month, 11 more victories carried him to 125. Then 7 more August 23, 1944, brought him past the 150 mark.

On August 1, 1944, Schuck was promoted to Leutnant and given the leadership of 10 Squadron. On September 30th he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, after 171 victories. Walter Schuck's final tally was 206 aerial victories, with the rank of Oberleutnant.

The Story

Arctic aerial combat was one of the most demanding forms of warfare known to man. This was primarily due to the elements, which posed harsh conditions on all combatants in the struggle that occurred near the Barents Sea, where the German Luftwaffe and Russian air forces were locked in a deadly clash. This fighting happened at the top of the world, above Norway in a theater known as the 'Polar Sea Front.' The Russians, supplied through the Allied PQ convoys destined for Murmansk and Archangel, tangled almost daily with the Luftwaffe.

These convoys were attacked constantly by both German aircraft and U-boats, especially during the long summer days of the far north. It was only during the long northern nights that the sailors felt a little safer. The Luftwaffe also defended German convoys which supplied bases along the coast of Norway. These convoys, escorted by destroyers and perhaps by flak ships (voorpostenboots), would sometimes be attacked by both British and Russian air forces. The purpose of these attacks was to both deny the enemy of supplies, and to prevent natural resources (iron ore, etc.) from being transported back to Germany to fuel the war effort. At the forefront of this conflict were the men and planes of 7/JG­5, based at Petsamo near Kirkenes, Norway.

EismeerDepicted in Robert Bailey's masterpiece, NORTHERN KNIGHT, is just such a scenario, where attacking British lend-lease Boston Bombers, flown by Russian aircrews, have set upon an arriving German supply convoy with a shipment intended for General Dietl's mountain troops. Arriving in time near the Varanger Peninsula to fend off the attacking Bostons, is experten pilot Walter Schuck ('Yellow Nine') and his wing man.

It was on an occasion similar to this (August 23, 1942), that Schuck had one of his most successful combats, surpassing 150 aerial victories. For the Russians, it was a day when they retreated to lick their wounds and plan for a better strategy to thwart the German presence.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>This exciting combat scenario places us just off the northern coast of Norway during March, 1944.

From this base he scored the majority of his long list of victories.</SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><SKU>RB-035</SKU><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><XmlPackage>product.simplevariantformat.xml.config</XmlPackage><ColWidth>4</ColWidth><SalesPromptID>1</SalesPromptID><Published>1</Published><RequiresRegistration>0</RequiresRegistration><RelatedProducts></RelatedProducts><MiscText></MiscText><TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor>0</TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor><TrackInventoryBySize>0</TrackInventoryBySize><TrackInventoryByColor>0</TrackInventoryByColor><IsAKit>0</IsAKit><IsAPack>0</IsAPack><PackSize></PackSize><ImageFilenameOverride>northern-knight_540.jpg</ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData><ProductVariant><Name>Limited Edition</Name><IsDefault>1</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-LE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With ONE co-signature.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>220</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>24x34</Dimensions><Inventory>225</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Artist's Proofs</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-AP</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With ONE co-signature.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription></SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><Price>250</Price><SalePrice></SalePrice><MSRP></MSRP><Cost></Cost><Weight></Weight><Dimensions>24x34</Dimensions><Inventory>20</Inventory><DisplayOrder></DisplayOrder><Colors></Colors><ColorSKUModifiers></ColorSKUModifiers><Sizes></Sizes><SizeSKUModifiers></SizeSKUModifiers><IsTaxable>1</IsTaxable><IsShipSeparately>1</IsShipSeparately><IsDownload>0</IsDownload><DownloadLocation></DownloadLocation><Published>1</Published><ImageFilenameOverride></ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData></ProductVariant><ProductVariant><Name>Remarqued Edition</Name><IsDefault>0</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-RE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>With ONE co-signature.

Oberleutnant Kurt Schulze began service as a cadet in 1939. As a wireless operator, he flew in Me­110's over southern Russia with 3.(F)11. From 1942-1944 he was Communications and Navigation Officer of 1/KG­2, and flew night missions to England as a navigator in Do­217's. While with KG­2, he became a pilot and in 1944, flew Me­109G's with III/JG­5 from Northern Finland and Norway. There, he participated in photo reconnaissance missions over Murmansk, (F)124. In early 1945 he commanded l/JG­51 in Gdansk, where he flew the last of his 103 missions and ended the war commanding 13/JG­5 in Norway. He was credited with 3 victories and holds the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, Flight Clasps, etc. After the war, he spent two years as a POW in France.

Oberleutnant Walter Schuck joined the Luftwaffe in 1937. He scored his first victory while with 7./JG­5 based at Petsamo on the Polar Sea. On June 5, 1942, he shot down 4 Russian fighters. His rate of victories increased steadily. During March 1944, he downed 7 Boston bombers and by April had 84 victories. On June 15th he scored 6 more, and on the 17th, 12 more victories in 24 hours! By August he had 150. Later in the war he flew the Me­262 jet with JG­7. He shot down four B­17's in the 262, with 8 victories total on the jet. His all-up score was 206 confirmed aerial victories. Awards include the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.

Unteroffizier Heinz Kern was born in 1922 on a farm in the Taunus region of Germany. He was interested in aviation from his childhood on reading books about famous pilots like the Red Baron. After flying gliders, receiving his pilots licence (1943) and fighter pilot training, he flew the Me­109 and FW­190 in France, Austria, Finland and Norway. He owns a hotel north of Frankfurt where his old friends of JG­5 meet for their annual reunion.

Feldwebel Dieter Weinitschke was born in 1920 in Berlin. He volunteered for the Luftwaffe in 1941 and was stationed in Finland with JG­5. He was soon recognized as an excellent fighter pilot in the Me­109. He also flew reconnaissance missions for Ju-87 and Ju-88 strikes against the Russian harbor of Murmansk. In 1942 he was shot down behind Russian lines, but three days later was rescued by a Fiessler Storch. A year later he parachuted from his Me­109 and became a POW in Russia. He is credited with 19 victories. With his many poems and writings he still has a special place in the hearts of his old friends of the JG­5 Eismeerjager.

Leutnant Heinrich Freiherr von Podewils joined the Luftwaffe in 1939. He flew Me­109's and FW-l90's in Bulgaria, Norway, Finland and in the 'Home Defence' (Reichsverteidigung). His victories include a Hurricane, a B­17 and a Beaufighter. He was shot down twice, including once over Germany by a P­47 Thunderbolt. In 1945 he commanded 8./JG­5 in Norway, where he became a POW of the Americans. He was turned over to the French. In January 1947, he escaped from a POW camp in France but was caught near the German border. He remained a prisoner in France until June 1947, two years after the end of the war.

Oberleutnant Ernst Scheufele was born in Walldorf, Germany. He joined the Luftwaffe in October 1940 and later flew the Me­109 with 4./JG­4, on 'Defense of the Reich' missions. He also flew the Me­109 with JG­5 from Norway. On December 3, 1944, he was shot down by American ground fire near Aachen. He has a total of 18 victories, including 3 four-engined bombers and 2 Mustangs. Ernst Scheufele flew 200 missions and holds the Frontflugspange in Gold.
The Story

Far to the north of Germany in one of the most inhospitable regions on the earth, stands Petsamo, Finland. In February 1944, a very closely knit unit of pilots and ground personnel of the Luftwaffe's JG­5 (also known as Eismeer Jager) manned this remote and isolated airfield 300 miles above the arctic circle and approximately 50 miles from the Russian port of Murmansk. The unit was one of the few defenders of German occupied airspace in this sector. It also often worked to protect General Dietl's mountain troops, who were guarding the German supply convoys on their way to the harbors of Kirkenes, Norway and Petsamo. They also protected other Luftwaffe bases near Petsamo and Kirkenes harbor, necessitating constant air patrols. Such close proximity to her adversary on the eastern front resulted in predictable violent encounters with the Russian Air Force who flew Sturmoviks and a variety of lend-lease aircraft from Britain and the USA, including Hawker Hurricanes and Bell P­39 Airacobras.

In Robert Bailey's painting, PETSAMO SCRAMBLE, Me­109's of JG­5 struggle valiantly to get airborne as Russian aircraft attack their airfield. The ensuing aerial maelstrom will be brief and deadly as yet another confrontation of adversaries is played out in this frigid battlescape.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>Me­109's of JG­5 struggle valiantly to get airborned as Russian aircraft attack their airfield.</SEDescription><SETitle></SETitle><SKU>RB-036</SKU><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><XmlPackage>product.simpleproduct.xml.config</XmlPackage><ColWidth>4</ColWidth><SalesPromptID>1</SalesPromptID><Published>1</Published><RequiresRegistration>0</RequiresRegistration><RelatedProducts></RelatedProducts><MiscText></MiscText><TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor>0</TrackInventoryBySizeAndColor><TrackInventoryBySize>0</TrackInventoryBySize><TrackInventoryByColor>0</TrackInventoryByColor><IsAKit>0</IsAKit><IsAPack>0</IsAPack><PackSize></PackSize><ImageFilenameOverride>petsamo-scramble_540.jpg</ImageFilenameOverride><ExtensionData></ExtensionData><ProductVariant><Name>Remarqued Edition</Name><IsDefault>1</IsDefault><SKUSuffix>-RE</SKUSuffix><ManufacturerPartNumber></ManufacturerPartNumber><Description>ONLY A FEW LEFT!

The Story

Life for the Fighter Squadrons of the 332nd Fighter Group, at the former farm field in Ramitelli, Italy in 1945, was about disciplined routine. Like other Fighter Groups in the 15th Air Force based nearby, it would start as it ended with the ground crews. With a mission planned and communicated they worked feverishly, many times without enough sleep, coaxing and prodding “their planes” to be ready in the morning to “loan out to the pilots.”

As the sun began to rise the air crews would awaken and begin preparation for the next mission. For some sleep did not come easy and did little to refresh their tired minds, a byproduct of aerial combat flown high above the hostile skies of Nazi Germany and Austria, locked in the deadly business of defending bomber streams they were tasked to escort against a resilient foe.

The tension would begin to build early as the air crews prepared for the coming mission. After a quick but subdued meal at the mess hall it was off to the briefing where the target for the day was announced and escort assignments were given. There they would be made aware of what defenses they could expect, the flak corridors they would navigate around and the anticipated reception from the Luftwaffe entering and exiting the target area; all the while they defended the bombers against a persistent enemy bent on bringing the four-engined ‘big friends’ down.

With the briefing concluded it was a short hop to the parachute shack to collect the necessities including escape kits before they were driven out to their dispersal areas. There they would confer with their crew chiefs, while being strapped in, about any issues the aircraft had since the last mission. The tension was now palpable as the pilots waited like coiled springs for the signal to start engines.

As the predetermined time arrived, magneto switches were turned on and engine generators whined and dozens of Merlin engines roared to life. The popping of hot gases exiting exhaust ports rose in harmony building to a low rumble, as chock blocks were pulled by ground crew attempting to stand against the prop wash. The high-powered planes assembled each in order of take off at the end of the respective runway.

With a shot from a Berry Pistol arching overhead signaling that the departure time had arrived, Flight Leaders and Wingmen would push their engine throttles foreword and the Rumble at Ramitelli would build. From a soft growl it would grow into a loud crescendo rising in unison with the other engines announcing that another Tuskegee Mission was about to commence.

In Robert Bailey’s latest action canvas, entitled RAMITELLI RUMBLE, ‘Little Freddio’ and ‘Lady Emmo’ of the 332 Squadron are the first to launch from the airfield and begin the process to assemble before turning to a northern heading that will take them to the rendezvous point where they will meet the bombers they are to escort to the heartland of Germany. They will need to be vigilant today if their record of never losing a bomber they escorted in combat, is to remain intact.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>This special release is made available almost exclusively with the release of Robert's book, A Brush with History.

The Story

By March of 1945, Germany was surrounded and fighting a purely defensive war. To the east, the Russian juggernaut, both army and air force, rushed headlong toward Berlin, crushing any resistance in its path. In the west, the Allies had crossed the Rhine River into Germany and were pushing the battered German army further east. To the south the Allies advanced north past Rome and into the Po Valley of Italy, ever closer to her homeland beyond the Italian and Austrian Alps.

The Allied air forces were relentless in their bombing and destruction of any effort put up by the beleaguered Luftwaffe in these final days. Among the fighter squadrons that were involved in the missions were the Tuskegee pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group. Flying out of Ramatelli, Italy, they continued their escort duties, providing the necessary protection for the bombers to hit their targets in central Germany. Many of these missions still met enemy resistance, and some of the air battles were fierce.

On some occasions they battled with the new Luftwaffe wonder weapons of jet and rocket design which, though technologically advanced, were too few in number and introduced too late to change the course of the war. Starved of fuel, the German war machine staggered on when it should have ended sooner. But Hitler insisted on battling on to ultimate self-destruction, both for himself and the German population.

In Robert Bailey's air combat painting, RED TAIL PASS, Tuskegee Mustangs are seen streaking over southern Germany on April 1, 1945. On this day and the preceding day, they destroyed 25 enemy aircraft with only 1 lost. It was a historic two-day period for the Tuskegee, of which they will always be proud.

Up front are 'Duchess Arlene' (1st Lt. Robert W. Williams) of 100 Fighter Squadron, and 'Creamer's Dream' (1st Lt.

The Story

The Avro Lancaster bomber was an awesome weapon of war. Developed from the Avro Manchester, the Lancaster came to represent the will of Commonwealth nations to carry the air war into Germany and occupied Europe. Able to carry four times the bomb load of a B­17, it flew by night across enemy territory, defying the Luftwaffe and destroying factories and cities.

KB­700 'Ruhr Express' was the first Canadian-built Lancaster, and flew with 405 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force. Designated 'Q' for Queenie, it was flown from Canada to England by Reg Lane, who then became C/O of 405 Squadron.

On the night of November 22, 1943, P/O H. A. Floren turned 'Ruhr Express' away from Berlin when the port outer engine failed. On December 20, the aircraft was transferred to 419 Squadron RCAF, which already had started to convert to Canadian-built Lancasters. It was thought that there were too many differences between the British- and Canadian-built Lancasters, causing maintenance problems. So they were separated for logistical reasons. 'Ruhr Express' ended up being totally destroyed when it struck a ground vehicle during landing. The crew survived.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>November 22, 1943, in the outskirts of Berlin, Germany. Two German officers and their lady friends arrive at a railway station.

The Story

Standing silently today in the fields near Bassingbourn, England, one can hear the rustling stalks of grain as they sway in the gentle breezes, accompanied by the song of an occasional meadow lark. It is the picture of peace and tranquility. But it was not always so. To understand the significance of these fields, one must squint through the mists of time, back some sixty years ago, when those fields were occupied by the 91st Bomb Group (H) of the USAAC (8th Air Force).

detailBack then, those same fields of wheat and oats lay flattened under the enormous wind generated by hundreds of radial engines, in preparation for an air armada destined for the Ruhr Valley in Germany. The ground would shake and the air would vibrate as wave after wave of B­17 Flying Fortresses lumbered down the airstrip under the weight of their lethal loads as they struggled to gain altitude for the day's mission. These were strikes to targets that would soon become familiar names to the young Americans who prepared the planes and the ones who flew them. Names like Hamm, Bremen, Meresburg and Schweinfurt. They named their planes after their hometown sweethearts, or from a sense of patriotism, of just from a sense of humor. Names like 'General Ike,' 'Nine-O-Nine,' 'Outhouse Mouse,' 'The Wild Hare,' 'Hellsapoppin',' 'Memphis Belle,' and 'Mary Ruth' are some.

The crews who returned to Bassingbourn were not the same as when they left. They had experienced a terror high over Germany that few can imagine. German fighters, anti-aircraft shells, sub-zero temperatures and the loss of close friends had altered their lives forever. The world has turned many times since those dark days when men of the 91st Bomb Group began building their proud history. A history based on duty, personal sacrifice and a belief in God and country. The fields around Bassingbourn have returned to their rural past as the men and machines have all but faded into the mists of time. What remains, as if distilled through the years, is the legend of the 'Ragged Irregulars.' The men who answered freedom's call with their blood, sweat and tears.

In Robert Bailey's exhilarating picture, RUHR VALLEY RAIDERS, Flying Fortresses of the 91st are seen high over Germany's heartland in early 1944. Cleared from the flak corridor over the target, aircrews are set upon by waves of cannon-equipped Me­109 'experten,' specifically trained to attack the multi-engined bombers. The men respond at every station with their twin fifties. It will be a long ride home.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>B­17's of the 91st Bomb Group are attacked over Germany by Me­109's.

The Story

Boeing's B­17, the mighty Flying Fortress, is one of the great aircraft to emerge from World War II. Forever in our minds will be the images of a vast armada of aircraft from the Mighty Eighth, penetrating the hostile skies over Europe. Plagued with the reputation of a 'hard luck outfit,' the Bloody Hundredth continually soldiered on through all the great aerial battles in the skies above war-torn Europe. On several occasions, this group suffered spectacular losses: as many as fifteen aircraft on one mission.

In SCALING THE ALPS, the B­17's are going to Africa to refuel after having bombed a major target in Germany. Many were damaged and didn't make it to their shuttle stop-over.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>August 17, 1943.

The Story

The supportive relationship that developed between bomber crew and fighter pilots of the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces in the ETO is legendary. It was a tight bond between the 'Big Friends' and their 'Little Friends,' the latter acting in a defensive role out of a desperate need to stem rising casualties among the bomber crews in the bleak years of 1942 and 1943.

In those dark days, bomber crews often had to face seasoned Luftwaffe pilots when they went beyond the limited range of USA and RAF fighters being used at that time. Crew and bomber losses rose alarmingly to unacceptable levels.

The air doctrine that grew out of this dilemma envisioned and achieved full escort coverage for the bomber crews, both to and from their continental targets. Additionally, newer and more potent fighter planes that had increased range, coupled with proven aggressive fighter tactics learned in the early years of the air war, wrestled the enemy skies from the Germans. This left the Luftwaffe as a shell of its former self.

Still, for the crippled stragglers in the wake of bomber streams who fell back from the protective pack of other 'heavies,' the prospect of being alone in the skies over Germany was nerve-wracking, to say the least. Marauding Focke-Wulfs and Messerschmitts often targeted these unfortunate crews as easy prey. Little Friends who responded to the radio pleas of these cripples, often beat back the aggressors and then escorted the bombers as they limped westward and home.

In Robert Bailey's painting STING OF THE YELLOW JACKETS, just such a scenario had unfolded. A single Flying Fortress finds itself all alone in enemy skies, damaged by flak during its bomb run. One engine has been shut down, control surfaces are shredded and there are wounded airmen aboard. Struggling to maintain altitude, the B­17 is attacked by two Me­109's bent upon its destruction. Fighters from the 361st Fighter Group, 375 Fighter Squadron enter the fray, destroying one of the attackers and driving off his wingman. The journey home will be uneventful, now that the injured crew have their own private escort of determined Little Friends.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>Spring of 1944.

The Story

As the Allied juggernaut rolled on toward the final collapse of the Third Reich in the spring of 1945, fighter aircraft of the 8th, 9th, 12th and 14th Air Forces fanned out in all directions, seeking targets of opportunity.

It was evident to all that the last days of the global struggle to end tyranny was near. It had taken four and a half years to arrive at this stage of the world war at great cost in human lives, both civilian and military against Germany, Italy and Japan. For the Germans, it had finally come down to this: a retreat back to its own borders, and a collapse into anarchy and foreign occupation. Faced with the Russians approaching the outskirts of Berlin in the east and the Allied armies crossing the Rhine in the west, the German army began its final retreat in disarray. By now, it was short of motivated foot soldiers and was desperate for supplies ranging from food and ammunition, to petrol.

Challenged with all this, they still had to face the 'Jabos,' which roamed the countryside, looking for anything and everything that moved and which could be interpreted as a target. It was at these times that the Germans paid their dearest price. Tanks, ground troops and armored personnel carriers were hit almost daily. These encounters were no piece of cake for the pilots either. It was serious business, often at very low altitudes and more dangerous than air to air combat.

In Robert Bailey's action drama, TUSKEGEE TITANS, P­51's of 99 Fighter Squadron , 322nd Fighter Group, have set upon an unfortunate armored column headed back to Germany in broad daylight.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>During the final months of World War II, the Tuskegee Airmen were extremely active escorting bombers, knocking down German fighters and strafing important ground targets.

F/Lt. Harry James Hardy, DFC, CD, joined the RCAF in 1941 and flew Tiger Moths, Cessna Cranes, Bolingbrokes, Lysanders, Huricanes, Kittyhawks and Harvards. After D­Day he was flying Typhoons with 440 Squadron, operating from B9 Cruelly, France. F/Lt. Hardy lost 'Pulverizer 1' when the whole squadron became lost while flying from Athens to Brussels, and all nine aircraft force-landed. 'Pulverizer 2' crash-landed during the Battle of the Bulge when hit by flak from a tank, but Hardy baled out again. 'Pulverizer 3' was taken off the line, presumably due to flak damage. He flew 'Pulverizer 4' to the end of his tour. He completed 96 sorties, with three force-landings and two bale-outs. F/Lt. Robert E. Spooner, DFC, joined the Air Force in 1941 at High River, Alberta. In September 1944 he commenced operations against the enemy with 438 Squadron at Melsbroek, flying Typhoons. By November he was a Flight Commander, and flew support for the Nijmegan attack and in the Ardennes. Other adventures included train-strafing and a mid-air collision in cloud, with both aircraft returning safely to base. F/Lt. Spooner completed 97 sorties.

F/O A. M. Scott. After training in Canada and a stint flying Miles Masters at Turnhill, England, Scott converted to Typhoons and joined 440 Squadron at Eindhoven, Holland. He flew a total of 30 operational trips. Among his many exciting experiences was a spectacular wheels-up landing in his Typhoon near the Rhine River after his tail had been damaged by flak.

F/Lt. Victor McMann joined the RCAF in 1941 at Winnipeg, Manitoba, and flew Cessna Twins and Venturas. He was then posted to Quebec to train on Hurricanes. In March, 1943 he was sent to Annette Island, Alaska (118 F.S.) and in April was in England with 438 Squadron. He acted in close army support throughout the invasion of Normandy on June 6, then on through France, Belgium, Holland and lastly, Germany. On his 63rd operational trip from Eindhoven, his Typhoon had a complete engine failure. He force-landed and was captured.

F/Lt. Alex A. MacDonald signed up with the Air Force on his 18th birthday, January 15, 1941 and was eventually posted to Turnhill, England, flying Miles Masters and Spitfires. After converting to Typhoons and joining 438 Squadron, he went on dive-bombing operations. He became a F/Lt. in 1942. On his first operational sortie, McDonald collided with another aircraft, totalling both planes. No-one was injured. He completed 36 operational sorties while with the squadron, and was awarded the 1939-1945 Star, Defence Medal, CVSM with clasp, and the Victory Medal.

F/Lt. Roy Burden was with 118 Squadron on Annette Island, Alaska, flying Kittyhawks in June of 1943. In November he joined 438 Squadron, training on Hurricanes and converting to Typhoons at Ayr, Scotland. In March 1944, Burden was on dive-bombing operations over Europe, striking V­1 launch sites. On D­Day he bombed coastal defences at dawn and witnessed the historic invasion from his Typhoon cockpit. On June 14 he was dive-bombing bridges and motor transport. Through August he was shooting up staff cars, despatch riders, etc. Shortly afterwards, he was severely injured while riding a captured motorbike, but was back with 438 Squadron by February. He then went to train-busting missions with delayed action bombs and flew his 98th and last operational sortie on May 3, 1945.

The Story

September 1944. As the Allies moved relentlessly eastward across France after D­Day, Typhoon pilots fearlessly flew at low level to support ground troops. Depicted is 'Pulverizer 2,' flown by F/Lt.Harry Hardy of 440 Squadron RCAF over Belgium.

Designed and introduced into RAF service as an interceptor, the Hawker Typhoon was employed during 1944-1945 as an instrument of tactical air support, attacking ground targets with bombs, rockets and cannon fire. Consequently it was admired and respected by troops, who witnessed first-hand the devastation it could cause.

All-Canadian 143 Wing comprised 438, 439 and 440 Squadrons, flying Typhoons. Each aircraft carried two 1000 pound bombs and four 20mm cannons. During the Normandy invasion period, 151 Typhoons pilots were killed from 450 Typhoons operating during this time. There is a monument to their honor at Villous Borage in Normandy, France. Twenty of these pilots were from the Canadian wing.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>German troops jump for cover in a Belgium street during 1944.

F/Lt. James Hardy was born in Verden, Manitoba. He joined the RCAF and flew Tiger Moths, Cranes, Lysanders, Bolingbrokes, Hurricanes, Kittyhawks and Harvards. Posted to England in 1943, he flew Spitfires. He was involved in a midair collision while flying a Spitfire, in which he was left with only his seat! He transitioned to Typhoons and was posted to 440 Squadron, operating from Cruelly, France. He had 96 sorties and was awarded the DFC and C.D.

F/Lt. Ken Storey joined 56 Squadron (Hurricanes) in the summer of 1941. They received the first two Typhoons issued to the Royal Air Force (September) and he flew one of these. He enjoyed two complete engine failures on Typhoons (for which they were renowned). His wrecked cockpit is currently on display at Duxford. He hit a Ju­88 on one sortie, and on a strafing run received a long line of bullet holes across the wing and spinner. At war's end he was with 29 Night Fighter Squadron (Mosquitos).

F/Lt. Art Younger joined the RCAF in January 1941. After serving in the Middle East during 1942, he was with 186 Squadron in Scotland on cannon-firing Hurricanes. Converted to Typhoon in November 1943. In 1944 he was with 247 Squadron RAF and was involved in Typhoon rocket attack operations in Normandy. He struck V­l sites, 'no-bail-out targets,' radar sites and other ground targets. He was shot down at Falaise on August 13, 1944 and was taken prisoner. He had a total of 69 operational sorties.

F/O Ralph Downing was born in Vernon, B.C. Graduating from pilot training in 1942, he was then posted to England with the RAF. By 1943 he was with 184 Squadron stationed near Bath, Somerset, on Hurricanes which featured 40mm anti-tank cannons which were later replaced with rockets. In early 1944 the squadron converted to Typhoons. This was a big improvement with 400 mph speed, and especially effective against Tiger tanks. F/O Downing was shot down by a German fighter on August 17, 1944 and became a POW.

F/Lt. C. Ivan Smith is from Ancaster, ON. He joined the RCAF and was sent to England in January 1943. He was posted to 268 Squadron RAF. By May 1944 he was on operations. On D­Day he was over the beach-head, directing fire for battleships on to ground targets. After the squadron moved to France, they were bombarded from a huge rail-mounted gun which the Germans kept in a tunnel. The gun was eventually sealed from both ends of the tunnel. C. Ivan Smith's awards include the 1939-1945 Star and Victory Medal. He flew Mustangs and Typhoons on operations.

F/O John Porter is from Prince George, B.C. and joined the RCAF in August 1941. In England he was posted to 247 Squadron RAF at Bradwell Bay in Essex. He flew Typhoons and completed his tour in November 1944. Awards include A/C Europe Star, 1939-1945 Medal, France/Germany.

F/Lt. Roy Burden was with 118 Squadron on Annette Island, Alaska, flying P-40 Kittyhawks during 1943. In November he joined 438 Squadron and by March 1944 was in Typhoons, dive-bombing V­l launch sites over Europe. On D­Day he bombed coastal defences and witnessed the spectacular invasion from his aircraft. On June 14 he took over B Flight, dive-bombing bridges and motor transport. His first European base was so close to the action that a left hand circuit on take-off drew enemy fire! He shot up enemy dispatch riders and staff cars, finishing with 98 operational sorties.

F/Lt. Bill Clifford enlisted in the air force at Hamilton, Ontario. After flight training his dream came true: he was flying Spitfires! But shortly thereafter, the entire group converted to Typhoons. Casualty rate on this aircraft was high, as they were much in demand after D­Day. At Eindhoven he was with 440 Squadron. Casualties were never ending. Fifteen pilots were KIA and four downed pilots became POW's before the war was over.

F/Lt. Don Banting joined the RCAF at 18 years of age. On D­Day +21 he was moved to B9 in France as a part of 143 Wing. On a raid against the railway marshalling yards at Munchen-Gladback on the edge of the Ruhr Valley, he came in extra low to deliver his bomb. The Germans always expected Typhoons to turn left at the end of a dive, so he turned right. The spectacular result was his bomb impacting right on the swtichgear without a shot being fired at him. He has 107 operational sorties. Awards include the DFC.

F/O Allan Nixon was born in Gore, PQ. He trained on Hurricanes, and by June 1944 was in Britain, OTU on Spitfires at Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire. He converted to Typhoons and was posted to 438 Squadron at Eindhoven, Holland, in December of 1944. He flew 16 operational trips before being shot down by ground fire and captured on Valentines Day, 1945. F/O Nixon was liberated from a POW camp near Mooseburg (along with 28,000 other prisoners) by General Patton's 3rd Army.

F/O Angus Mclntyre Scott joined the RCAF in November, 1942. After flight training he took a Commando course in Nova Scotia. In England he was with 61 Squadron OTU, flying Spitfire 5's, but converted to Typhoons in February 1945. He joined 440 Squadron at Eindhoven, Holland, flying 30 operational sorties. He made a wheels-up landing in a Typhoon after flak damage to the tail. He went on to take the fight against the enemy from numerous bases until war's end.

F/Lt. Ivan Mouat joined the RCAF in 1940. He trained at #3 ITS at Victoriaville, PQ, #3 EFTS Regina and #11 SFTS Yorkton, SK. Shipped overseas in September 1941. He was posted to 412 Squadron on Spitfires, then to 56 Squadron on Typhoons. He was one of the first four Canadian pilots to fly this new aircraft type. He was then with 198 Squadron, also Typhoons. Ivan Mouat was shot down on July 11, 1943 and was taken a prisoner in Stalag Luft III. He has a total of 25 operational sorties.

F/O George 'Lefty' Whitman was born in Pennsylvania, and enlisted in the RCAF in 1941. In September 1942 he was posted to England with #3 (F) Squadron RAF at Manston, flying Hurricanes, Typhoons and Tempests. Shot down in September 1943 by flak and ditched in the sea. (First ever ditching of a Typhoon). While in his dinghy was strafed and wounded by two Me­109's. His dinghy was sunk but he was rescued by a Walrus aircraft. He later destroyed an Me­109G, the first enemy aircraft destroyed by a Tempest in the air. F/O Whitman also shot down 14 flying bombs. Later in the war he became a test pilot. His decorations include France/Germany Star and Air Defence Great Britain Medal.

F/Lt. Robert E. Spooner joined the Air Force in 1941 and received Elementary Flight Training at High River, AB. In 1944 he was posted to Melsbroek to fly Hawker Typhoons. A few weeks later he was in Eindhoven, Holland. By November of that same year he was a Flight Commander. He flew support for the Nijmegan attack and in the Ardennes 'Battle of the Bulge.' Other adventures included train strafing and a mid-air collision in cloud, although both aircraft returned safely to base. F/Lt. Spooner completed 97 sorties and holds the DFC.
The Story

The lightning advances made by the Allies after D­Day during 'Operation Cobra' and the breakout from Normandy, came to a grinding halt as supply lines stretched and German entrenchment solidified. Through the fall and into the winter, the lines of battle faltered to a stalemate, allowing the Allies to regroup and rest. Or so they thought.

Hitler had other ideas, and although cautioned to the contrary by his military advisers, designed a battle plan based on surprise and secrecy. Code named 'Autumn Mist,' the plan was to quietly amass men, tanks and planes in the Ardennes for a 'blitzkrieg' thrust to the Meuse River and on to Antwerp, in the hopes of literally dividing the Allies and repeating another 'Dunkirk.' He chose a spot on the American lines that was thinly defended.

The Allies were confident that the Germans were not capable of such an action, and were thrown into chaos when the Germans smashed through the American lines, spear-headed by two Panzer Divisions on the morning of December 16, 1944. For ten days the Germans benefited immensely from the foul weather which grounded the Allied air forces. The German advances became known as the 'Battle of the Bulge.'

With the weather finally improving on the morning of December 24, the German advance had run its course, literally running out of gas. Allied planes poured into the battle front by the hundreds, destroying everything in front of them.

In Robert Bailey's painting, TYPHOON TARGET, a King (Royal) Tiger, low on gas and nakedly exposed to air attack, runs for the cover of trees, pursued by two Typhoons of 440 Squadron, 143 Wing (RCAF), 2nd Tactical Air Force. Like 600 other units of German armor, it will not likely find a place to hide in the face of Allied counter attacks.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>December 1944.

The Story

Late summer of 1944. A westbound German train just north of the Ruhr, receives a warm welcome by Hawker Typhoons of 438 Squadron, RCAF. During this period, Allied fighters dominated the skies of Europe, seeking targets. There was nothing more inviting for Typhoons than a train carrying troops and munitions to the front. Such train always received an immediate and devastating response from these heavily armed fighters, flown by brave pilots who daily experienced heavy flak. This was particularly dangerous to low-flying aircraft. However, Typhoons were used to great effect, bringing the German war machine to a virtual standstill with respect to movement of war material.

This particular train has just left a tunnel, but at the wrong moment. Immediately spotted by the Typhoons, it is immobilized first with bombs aimed at the track ahead and behind it, then with cannon fire into the locomotive. In moments, the rail cars will be exploding and ablaze.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>Late summer of 1944.

UNSCHEDULED ARRIVAL at about the halfway mark. Still to go in are the human figures and aircraft. As you can see, the signal box is only roughed in at this stage. The painting took about six weeks to produce.
The Story

It was the night of August 25, 1944. 627 Squadron Mosquito pilot Bob Boyden and his navigator Ralph Fenwick had just marked the marshalling yards for an incoming Lancaster raid at Darmstadt, Germany. Bob was down on the deck with throttles wide open, heading home, when he chanced upon a railway station at Kaiserslautern. The Germans didn't have time to react, and still had their lights turned on.

The Story

"In the evening, it was 'A' flight's turn. I was Barley Blue 3. About 40 miles south of Caen at 7000 feet, we were looking for German transport moving up to the front. As we were flying on an easterly course, the sun was behind us; always dangerous. Suddenly, I saw a half dozen FW­190's coming in quickly out of the sun on our starboard rear quarter, with more 190's higher, behind them.

"'Barley squadron break right! 190's coming down!' I called, and immediately there was a great melee of two dozen aircraft twisting and turning and firing, a real old fashioned scrap. I was somewhat surprised that the FW's didn't dive through at high speed as usual, but a number of them, at least, stayed to fight.

"After two or three hard descending steeps turns to the right, I managed to latch onto the tail of a 190, but he dove steeply out to the east. I followed at full throttle to ground level and caught up to him. One short burst at 300 yards with both cannon and machine gun and the FW crashed into the trees in a great ball of fire. Flight Lt. R. Bouskill, Blue 4, who had remained with me, confirmed this action."

Staffelkapitan Siegfried Mueller was, born in Silkau (Sachseny) and joined the Lufwaffe in 1941. During 1943 and 1944 he was with JG­B1 in Italy, Sturmstaffel 1 in Berlin, and IV Gruppe JG­3. In April 1945, he flew with JG­7 and was made a POW by the Americans at war's end. He racked up 181 sorties, with 17 victories on the western front and 3 in the east, for a total of 20. He had two bailouts and five crash landings. Staffelkapitan Mueller led JG­3 into the attack on Eindhoven during 'Operation Bodenplatte' in 'Red 10.' Decorations include Iron Cross 2nd Class, Iron Cross 1st Class, and German Cross in Gold.

Feldwebel Oscar Boesch joined the Lufwaffe in 1942 and volunteered for SturmsStaffel 1, a specially formed unit charged with attacking the heavy daylight bombers. On his first mission he downed a B­17 but was almost killed when he flipped his FW­190 on landing. On his second mission he was shot down while attacking a formation of B­24's, although he downed one of them. His good luck helped him survive through eight FW­190's that he totaled while in action. Feldwebel Boesch has 18 confirmed victories, and has the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class. On his last of 120 combat sorties, he collided with a Yak-9 west of Berlin, was captured by the Russians and escaped. Today, he still flies at air shows in the USA and Canada.

Staffelkapitan Richard Franz joined the Lufwaffe in 1940. By June of 1942 he was in Africa with 9/JG­27, escorting Stuka missions. After recovering from malaria he was with 3/JG­77 in September 1943, flying missions on various fronts in Italy. He then volunteered for Sturmstaffel 1 and was later with 7/JG­ll as Staffelkapitan. While with this unit, he flew in 'Operation Bodenplatte,' striking two allied airfields near Maastricht, Netherlands. Near war's end he was shot down by Russian fighters and spent three years in captivity. He has 23 victories, plus 4 Russian T-34 tanks. Decorations include Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, and Flight Clasps in Bronze, Silver and Gold.

Oberleutnant Kurt Schulze began service as a cadet in 1939. As a wireless operator, he flew in Me­110's over southern Russia with 3.(F)11. From 1942-44 he was Communications and Navigation Officer of l/KG­2, and flew night missions to England as a navigator in Do­217's. While with KG­2, he became a pilot and in 1944, flew Me­109G's with III/JG­5 from Northern Finland and Norway. There, he participated in photo reconnaissance missions over Murmansk, (F)124. In early 1946 he commanded l/JG­61 in Gdansk, where he flew the last of his 103 missions and ended the war commanding 13/JG­B in Norway. He was credited with 3 victories and holds the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, Flight Clasps, etc. After the war, he spent two years as a POW in France.

Leutnant Theo Nau joined the Lufwaffe in 1943. His first missions were in home defense (Reichsverteidigung) with 7/JG­ll and later during the German offensive in the Ardennes. The 'Bodenplatte' mission took him to Asch in Holland, striking P­47's. On January 14, 1945, he was shot down by Captain Joe Gordner of the 365th Fighter Group. Lt. Nau parachuted from his stricken aircraft and after some time in hospital, joined JG­77 in Czechoslovakia. His last flight was in an Me­109 on May 8, 1946. At war's end he was a POW of the Americans and was turned over to the Russians. He escaped and fled to West Germany, where he was released by USA occupation troops.

Unteroffizier Herbert Dosch is from Darmstadt and entered the Lufwaffe in 1940. He flew the FW-44, Kl-36, Bu-131, Bu-181, Arado 66, Arado 96, FW-56, Devotine 520, He-61, Me­108, Me­109 and FW­190. His first mission was in the FW­190. In 1944 he was in the Home Defence (Reichsverteidigung) with II/JG­1 and was credited with his first victory. During his 7th mission, he was wounded and parachuted. He flew in France during the Allied invasion, and was wounded again. At the end of 1944 a Spitfire again caused him to use his parachute. During 'Operation Bodenplatte' his target was the airport at St. Denis-Westrem in Belgium.

Unteroffizier Fritz Weiner joined the Lufwaffe in 1942 at the age of 17. In 1944 he briefly served with Jagdgruppe 200 during the Allied invasion. In October 1944 he was transferred to II.7/JG­l1. In mid-December the unit was ordered to support German ground troops in the Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) and participated in Operation Bodenplatte. Mid-January saw Unteroffizier Weiner re-deployed to Berlin/Straussberg to fight advancing Soviet forces. On January 29, 1946, he was shot down by Soviet flak and severely wounded. He was hospitalized until the war's end, having completed about 25 missions.
The Story

As 1944 came to a close, Germany stood defiant. She was surrounded by the advancing Russian Juggernaut on her eastern border, and the American and British armies and air forces in the west. Her industrialized cities lay in ruins, victims to the incessant day and night bombing campaigns by the Allies. The German population had grown weary after nearly three years of worsening news and ever increasing hardships in supporting the war effort.

One of Germany's last desperate attempts to reverse the tide of war was initiated on January 1, 1945, in 'Operation Bodenplatte.' It was designed to deliver a fatal blow to the Western Allied Forces by destroying their parked and fueling planes on the ground early in the morning. Instead, it was a disaster from which the Luftwaffe would never recover.

detailEvery available front line combat aircraft, consisting of over 800 Luftwaffe planes, were utilized for the attack at Allied airfields west of the battle line. The series of air raids cost the Luftwaffe a price in pilots and planes they could not afford to lose. At day's end, over 230 pilots and 300 planes were lost, while the Allies lost about 200 planes and a small number of pilots. In addition, the loss of nearly 30 Luftwaffe Commanders was a cost that was not realized until too late. Clearly, it was a campaign born out of desperation. Germany had spent its last hope of a turn-around in the conflict and had lost. The road to defeat for Germany would be shorter now, and would end a few months later in Unconditional Surrender.

In Robert Bailey's combat painting, WAKEUP CALL!, raiding Focke Wulf 190's of IV/JG­3, and Messerschmitt 109's are seen strafing the airfield at Eindhoven, Holland. Confusion reigns on the ground, with pilots and ground crews scrambling for slit trenches and foxholes. German fighters streak across the aerodrome, pumping cannon shells into every airplane they see.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>January 1, 1945.

Oscar BoeschA native of Austria, Oscar Boesch grew up in the mountains and was inspired by the eagles to fly. After learning to design, build and fly gliders as a teenager, his love of flying led him to join the Luftwaffe in August 1942. He then enjoyed a short but distinguished career as a combat pilot.

He volunteered to become a member of Sturm Staffel 1, a specially formed unit charged with destroying American daylight bombers. During his first mission on April 29, 1944, he almost died when he crash-landed and flipped his plane onto its back. On May 8, he was shot down while attacking a 40-plane B­24 formation, after downing one. During his 12 months as a combat flyer, there was a 350% pilot turnover rate in his Staffel. Boesch was himself wounded a few times, twice so severely that he was removed from flying duties. He had eight Focke Wulf 190's destroyed.

But it wasn't all in vain. It is estimated that the Staffel had been able to prevent 30,000 tons of Allied bombs from falling upon German soil. By war's end, Boesch had earned both the Iron Cross Second Class and First Class, and had downed eighteen enemy aircraft, including a Spitfire, a Mustang, six B­17's two B­24's, four IL­2's, two Lagg­5's, and two Yak­9's.

Boesch's operational flying ended in April 1945. On his last of 120 combat sorties, his FW­190 collided with a Yak­9 northeast of Berlin. He was captured by the Russians after parachuting to safety, but escaped and walked 1000 km back home to Austria.

In 1951 he emmigrated to Canada with his wife Editha and baby Roland, to build a future. Over fifty years after the war, Oscar Boesch still enjoys flying. He is an avid pilot, performing at airshows across the continent in his sailplane 'Wings of Man.' He has also performed in the IMAX movie, Silent Sky.
The Story

The lightning victories enjoyed by the Germans during the first years of World War II were due in large part to the Luftwaffe. But by the fall of 1944, they were retreating. All available resources were prepared for a last, desperate gamble. On December 16, 1944, Hitler launched a huge offensive in bad weather. Aircraft from both sides were unable to participate during the opening days of what was later to be called 'The Battle of the Bulge.'

With the return of good weather after Christmas, the ground battle reached its climax. At this point, Allied and German pilots were eager to lend support to the monumental clash of armies.

This gripping painting, WAR WOLF, puts us a few hundred feet above the treetops of the German/Belgian border at 11:15 AM on December 27. Eleven FW­190's of IV Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 3 "Udet," led by Leutnant Glaubig, were flying over the Eifel at low level to avoid radar. Suddenly, ground control radioed a desperate message: "Achtung! Fifty-plus Indians in Ida Richard Five!" These American fighters were probably from the 352nd Fighter Group.

In the wild melee that followed, Feldwebel Oscar Boesch was too low to bail out if his aircraft was hit. He managed to shoot down one Mustang into the trees and escape with his life. However, six other pilots of IV Gruppe were not so lucky: Leutnant Glaubig, Unteroffizier Leuchtenberger, Unteroffizier Rusch, Leutnant Rennwanz, Gefreiter Stumpf, and Oberfahnrich Buechsenmann, were killed in the morning's action. The loss of so many experienced pilots was another blow from which the Luftwaffe could not recover. Five days later, on New Year's Day, over 150 German aircraft would be lost during attacks upon Allied airfields. After the 'Battle of the Bulge,' the Luftwaffe was only a shadow of its former self, but the pilots gave their best to the end.</Description><SEKeywords></SEKeywords><SEDescription>December 27, 1944.

The Story

Westjet began service in 1996 with 220 employees, utilizing a fleet of three used Boeing 737-200 aircraft. Initially, service between Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Kelowna and Vancouver was offered. Within months, several new routes were added, and WestJet has been growing at a steady pace ever since.

Now serving virtually every major city in Canada, the Calgary based airline has also launched many scheduled flights to the U.S., using state of the art Boeing 737-700 aircraft, incorporating winglet technology to decrease fuel costs. With all of its 737-200 aircraft due to be phased out by the year 2008, its fleet will become the youngest in North America.

Conceived as a low-cost discount carrier, WestJet has proved it could create a market  which did not previously exist, challenging bloated fares demanded by other domestic airlines of the time.
