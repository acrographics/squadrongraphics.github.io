<strong>MicroPay Account <br>
&nbsp;</strong><p>When you purchase stories at {YOUR STORE NAME}, you have the choice 
of using a credit card for each purchase or setting up a MicroPay account. </p>
<p><b>What's a MicroPay Account?</b><br>
It's a place holder for money that you &quot;deposit&quot; every now and then using either 
credit card or check. Whenever you go to your shopping cart, you can &quot;purchase&quot; 
MicroPay account dollars in $5 increments. That money goes into your account 
here at {YOUR STORE NAME}.Net. You can use that money to buy stories in the future.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why would I want to do that?</b><br>
It allows you to quickly purchase individual books without putting your credit 
information in every time. Also, it avoids a per-transaction fee of 50 cents 
that we need to charge for small purchases (under $5). So, it's a quick and easy 
way for you to purchase individual books whenever you want, economically. <br>
<br>
<b>What's this per-transaction fee?</b><br>
Credit card processors charge us money to guarantee your credit. This charge is 
40 cents, plus about three percent of the transaction. If we did not pass this 
fee through to you, we'd lose money! Think of it this way: if you buy a short 
story for 50 cents, and we have to pay the author a 30% royalty, then we have to 
pay 42 cents to the credit processing agent, we'd be out of business pretty 
quickly! </p>
<p>So, for purchases below $5, we add a 50 cent &quot;small transaction fee.&quot; For 
purchases over $5, we cover the cost of the transaction out of our profits. If 
you're the type of person who likes to buy individual books one or two at a 
time, and you don't want to get hit with this 50 cent fee each time, then we 
suggest you set up a MicroPay account with us. </p>
<p><b>How do I set up a MicroPay Account?</b><br>
Easy! Just go to the shopping cart. There's always a line item called &quot;Add $5 to 
my MicroPay account&quot;. By default, it has a quantity of &quot;0&quot;. Simply increase the 
quantity to &quot;1&quot; and then check out, then $5 will appear in your MicroPay 
account. If you want to add more money, in $5 increments, then increase the 
quantity to 2 or more. <br>
<br>
<b>Can I buy some books at the same time I add money to my MicroPay account?<br>
</b>Sure! Buy a few eBooks and add $5 to your account at the same time. Then, 
next time you want to buy an eBook you can use your MicroPay account instead of 
having to pull out your credit card. </p>
<p><b>How do I know how much money is left in my MicroPay account?</b> <br>
It's always listed on your Bookshelf as well as your shopping cart. Just login 
and go to either of those pages, and your balance will be displayed near the top 
of the screen. </p>
<b>How do I use my MicroPay account instead of a credit card to buy eBooks?<br>
</b>If you have enough money in your MicroPay account to cover the items in your 
shopping cart, then a button will appear automatically that allows you to choose 
between using a credit card and your MicroPay account. By default it will be set 
to use your MicroPay account. If for some reason you'd prefer to use a credit 
transaction, just click on the &quot;credit card&quot; choice. It couldn't be much 
simpler! 
<p>If there's not enough money in your MicroPay account to pay for the current 
items in your cart, you'll need to use your credit card as usual. You might want 
to put some more money in your MicroPay account at the same time to save 
keystrokes next time you buy an eBook. </p>
<b>Can I add money to my MicroPay account using a check or money order?<br>
</b>Sure! Mail a check along with a note that gives us your login ID and your 
email address printed clearly, and we'll deposit the money in your account when 
we get it. Money orders clear immediately, but there will be a two week hold on 
checks to allow them to clear. We'll send you email when the money shows up in 
your account. 
<p>Mail money orders (preferred!) or checks to:<br>
<br>
<b>{YOUR STORE NAME}<br>
{YOUR STORE ADDRESS}<br>
</b></p>
<p><b>Can I add money to my MicroPay account using PayPal?<br>
</b>Sure! Send the payment to <a href="mailto:{YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS}">
{YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS}</a>&nbsp;and make sure you include your {YOUR STORE NAME} Member 
Login ID in the message and please try to have your email at PayPal match your 
email address in the {YOUR STORE NAME} system (to check go to your Bookshelf and 
click on UPDATE MY PROFILE).<br>
<br>
<b>Can I FAX in my credit information instead of using your online cart?</b><br>
Sure! FAX us your credit card number, expiration, account login ID, and email 
address to: {YOUR PHONE NUMBER}. Be sure to tell us how much money to put in your 
MicroPay account. The minimum is $5. <b><br>
<br>
If I decide I no longer want to buy eBooks from {YOUR STORE NAME}.Net, can I get my 
account money back?<br>
</b>Sure! Send an email to <a href="mailto:{YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS}">
{YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS}</a> and tell us your login id and email address, and 
ask us for a refund. We'll get it out to you within 60 days. <!-- insert main text above ----------------------------------------->
